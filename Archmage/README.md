# Welcome to Archmage Mod!
Do you feel that the ability system of Rogue Legacy 2 is too complicated?
Do you rarely feel the need to use your Weapon and prefer swinging Spells?
I am happy to present to you, the Archmage mod!

Mod requested by: @Gridd from the CDG Discord Server

## This mod contains
1. Characters have weapons. Just weapons. All ability slots are rerolled into a random weapon.

## Notes
1. Doesn't work well with True Rogue (still gives you just spells, but you don't get the Crippling Intellect Trait)
2. For some reason doesn't work on Thanathophobias (I dunno why tho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)

## How to install?
1. Download the file.
2. Backup your "Assembly-CSharp.dll" file located in "GamePath/Rogue Legacy 2_Data/Managed".
3. Replace the file with the modded one.
4. Have fun!
