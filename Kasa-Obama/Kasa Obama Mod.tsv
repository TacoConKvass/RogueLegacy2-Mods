LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_DIALOGUE_INTRODUCTION_1	Ooooh Ducky, thank you so much for this extravagant tent!</LB></LB>  The Ka flowing through it is so overwhelming that it's making me <size=150%>DIZZY!</size></CR>  ... Just kidding!  I saw the price tag <size=75%>(Talk about cheap).</size></LB> The only thing making me dizzy are the fumes from all the cleaning agents I had to use.</LB></LB> ... Couldn't you get a girl anything better?</CR>   Whelp, beggars can't be choosers... So I've decided not to be poor anymore!</LB></LB>  Now let's talk about Magic with a capital <size=150%>M</size> <size=75%>(for <color=blue>money</color>)!</size></LB> Because let me tell you Ducky, enchantments are not cheap.</CR>   Find me some sweet <color=blue>Runic Stones</color> and I can grant you powers you couldn't even dream of!</LB> Like stealing the lifeforce from your enemies, or being slightly magnetic!</LB></LB>  ... And that's it.  That's all I've got... until you find me those <color=blue>Runic Stones</color> Ducky!	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_DIALOGUE_EXPLAINING_STACKING_1	Oooh, Ducky, is that a duplicate <color=blue><b>Runic Stone</b></color> you have there?</LB> Well, aren't you in for a treat!  Do you want to know what I can do with it?</CR>  If you were going to say 'stack them'...</LB></LB>  ... You'd be wrong!</CR>   ... No, you were right.  All I can do is stack them. </LB> But that doesn't mean it's easy to do!</LB></LB>   Stacking is little bit more... Expensive with a capital <size=150%>E</size> <size=75%>(for <color=blue>extremely</color>)</size>.	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_DIALOGUE_EXPLAIING_HEIRLOOMS_1	NOT PLAYED (WHICH IS GOOD, LORE HAS CHANGED)  Ohhhh, Ducky, there's something different about you.</LB> ... Did you lose weight?  Get a perm? No, that's not it...</LB></LB>  There's a shimmer of energy around you...</CR>  Ducky. How many <color=blue>Heirlooms</color> are  you carrying?</LB> ....... Orrr, should I say how many <color=blue>Heirlooms</color> <size=150%>AREN'T</size> you carrying?</CR>  <color=blue>Heirlooms</color> are objects of immense power that bind themselves to passing souls.</LB> But the <color=blue>Heirlooms</color> you're carrying aren't bound to you...</CR>  Ducky, this is weird with a capital <size=150%>W</size> <size=75%>(for... <color=blue>weird</color>)</size>.</LB></LB>  Let's keep this a secret between you and me for now.  I don't know what's goin' on with you, but I don't think you want anyone else knowin' either!</CR>   So if anyone else gets the jeebies around you, just make sure to turn and tail and leave!</LB></LB>    Whelp, we've talked enough. C'mon and buy something from me!	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_DIALOGUE_SPECIAL_INTRO_TOPSIDE_1	Hello Ducky... It's a little late for asking a girl for her wares don't 'cha think?</CR>  While you were out doing your heroics, I missed out on all the fun!</LB> And on all the money!</LB> <size=75%>(my gosh, the <color=blue>money</color>!)</CR>    Whelp, beggars can't be choosers... So I've decided not to be poor anymore!</LB></LB>  Now let's talk about Magic with a capital <size=150%>M</size> <size=75%>(for <color=blue>money</color>)!</size></LB> Because let me tell you Ducky, enchantments are not cheap.</CR>   Find me some sweet <color=blue>Runic Stones</color> and I can grant you powers you couldn't even dream of!</LB> Like stealing the lifeforce from your enemies, or being slightly magnetic!</LB></LB>  ...

LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_WELCOME_1	Hello Ducky, come to give me money?	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_WELCOME_2	I was just looking for you, Ducky.  I need someone to buy stuff from me.	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_WELCOME_3	Hi Ducky!

LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_WELCOME_5	Looking a little light on enchantments, Ducky!

LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_BUY_FAILURE_ORE_1	Sorry, my sweet Duckling.  I need more <color=blue>Red Aether</color>.	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_GEAR_CHATTER_1	Ooooh, that looks divine.  You should definitely buy it.	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_GEAR_CHATTER_2	It's rude to stare.  You should buy something!	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_GEAR_CHATTER_3	I bet that would look good on you.  Why not buy two?	
LOC_ID_ENCHANTRESS_SMALL_TALK_GEAR_CHATTER_4	You shoppin' or just loiterin' around?

LOC_ID_ARCHITECT_DIALOGUE_INTRODUCTION_1	Oooh, what do we have here?</LB> Why hellooo Child!  Have you come to speak to me?  An ollld man?</CR>  It is good that you speak with your elders.  We have a lot of wisdom to teach.</LB> A lot of... storrrries to tell.</CR>   Now, now, where are my manners?  I haven't introduced myself!</LB></LB>  My name is Olllld Man, and my defining trait is being ollllllld!</LB> And you... I shall call you Child, for your defining trait is that you have no past history.</CR>  But I can fix that.  I can help you find that history you so desperately need.</LB> See this drill?  I can use it to lock the Kingdom down and prevent it from ever changing.</LB></LB>  Now you can search corners never scoured, and battle monsters you've failed to conquer.</LB> You can become a hero and tell your own stories!</CR>   Of course, if you use the drill there is an olllld man's finder fee.</LB></LB> Why aren't my services free, you ask? Because I am ollllld man.</LB> Not dummmmmb man, or generous man.  	
LOC_ID_ARCHITECT_DIALOGUE_FAILED_1	Child, I'd love to take your money, but my machine doesn't seem to be working.</LB></LB>  Maybe there is no Kingdom to lock, or maybe I am toooo old and I don't know what I'm doing.	
LOC_ID_ARCHITECT_DIALOGUE_OTHER THINGS TO SAY_1	Oooh, look at me ramble.  I am sorry Child.  I am sooo old.  What is your reason?  I got my hunch from being alive all these years.  It is good to have a terrible hunch from all these years of being alive.

LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_INTRO_ARCHERY_1	Hey bub, ready to test your archery skills?</LB>You get one chance, but it's free of charge!  Win and there's a sweet prize in it for you.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_OFFER_ARCHERY_1	Hit enough targets with a bow and arrow, and you'll get a sweet reward.  Wanna give it a go?	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_WIN_LOW_ARCHERY_1	Pretty pathetic, you only hit {0} targets.  I wouldn't even give you a sticker, but upper management thinks you deserve a reward...	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_WIN_HIGH_ARCHERY_1	Wow, you hit {0} targets!  Keep this up and you'll put me out of a job (please)!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_FAIL_ARCHERY_1	I'd say you were the best shooter of the day but that'd be lie.  Good luck with the rest of the castle!

LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_WIN_BOUNCE_1	Hey, you hit {0} targets!  I guess hitting (most) immobile targets is a talent worthy of a reward.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_WIN_LOW_BOUNCE_1	Wow, you hit {0} targets!  Looks like you're great at bouncing balls.  Looks like you know your Grade 1 angels!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_FAIL_BOUNCE_1	This is where I'd wish you best of luck, but no amount of luck's gonna save you.  Now git!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_OUTRO_TALK_1	Y'know these challenges are just an enlistment guise right?  The real reward is being put on a secret conscription list.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_OUTRO_TALK_2	I show the King one game I made, and now I'm the official Kingdom's official clown.  There goes my Chemistry degree.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_OUTRO_TALK_3	You'd think these balloons were filled with helium, but they're actually being lifted by magic.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_OUTRO_TALK_4	This job sucks, but you can't beat the perks.  I've got enough red aether for a thousand lifetimes.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_CLOWN_OUTRO_TALK_5	You've got a lot of questions, and I've got a lot of nothing to talk about.  You should make like my degree and disappear.

LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_CONFIRM_MENU_TITLE_1	Unlock Pizza Route?	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_CONFIRM_BUTTON_OK_1	Sure!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_CONFIRM_BUTTON_CANCEL_1	Maybe Next Time	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_TITLE_1	Pizza Girl	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_INTRO_TALK_1	Hey there Stranger!  Didn't think I'd meet anyone this far out, but I'm sure glad you showed up!</LB></LB>  Name's Maria by the way.</CR>  I was heading to the Sun Tower when a <color=purple>Shift</color> happened, and some monsters teleported right beside me!</LB> So I ran back here to my pizza shop, and decided to lay low until they left...</LB></LB>   Or until someone got rid of them.  Thanks for that, by the way.</CR>  Anyway, I can tell from your get-up that you're not from around here.</LB> Juuuuust a wild guess, but you're from above, right?  Trying to open that giant gold door?</LB></LB>  Don't worry, I won't pry.  Just sayin' that maybe I can help.</CR>  If you ever get the chance, come meet me by one of the teleporters.</LB> Maybe we can work together.</CR>  Thanks again for the save, but I'd better be going.</LB></LB>  I'd like to study the teleporters while I have the chance...	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_INTRO_REPEAT_1	Don't worry, I'm just catching my breath.  The Tower teleporter is just above, so go on ahead and I'll meet you there!</LB></LB>  I didn't go through two weeks of delivery-person training for nothing!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_POP_UP_1	Unlocking this Pizza Delivery Route for all future runs will cost {0} gold.  Would you like to unlock it?	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_EXPLAIN_TALK_1	Hey again, Stranger!</LB> So you're interested in hearing my proposal?  How exciting!</LB></LB>  I was afraid you'd ghost me.  Your lack of response and facial expressions makes you quite hard to read.</CR>   First, let me do a proper introduction: </LB> Name's Maria - Pizza delivery girl by day, amateur geologist by night.</LB></LB>  Don't let my job title fool you, delivering food isn't easy when everything keeps <color=purple>Shifting</color>.</LB> One wrong step and you could end up being the toppings.</CR>  But I'm different.  I can 'feel' the <color=purple>Shift</color>, and can tell when things have moved and where they'll end up...</LB></LB> And that's how you and I can work together!</LB></LB>  See this portal? It's bound to other portals via <color=purple>Currents</color>.</LB> Once a portal is activated you can keep going back to it, but if a <color=purple>Shift</color> occurs, that connection is lost.</CR>  I've been studying these portals (and using them for deliveries) for a while now, so I've grown pretty attuned to the <color=purple>Currents</color>.</LB></LB>  And if you give me enough resources, I think I can unlock these portals for you permanently!</CR>  What's in it for me you didn't ask?  Well, if I can keep these portals open, then I can start helping others who are stuck because of them.</LB></LB>  Not everyone can cross these treacherous regions on their own, so having these portals would be a literal lifesaver!</CR>   So whaddaya say?  You get to traverse the world more easily, and I get to help people in need.</LB></LB>  All it takes is {0} gold.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_EXPLAIN_REPEAT_1	I'll need {0} gold to permanently unlock this teleporter.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_NO_1	Not interested?  That's okay, Stranger, I know you'll come around.  Good things come to those who help.</LB></LB>  Also, I've still got pizza to deliver.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_FAIL_1	Great!  But you don't have enough gold.  Sorry, I can't unlock portals with hopes and dreams.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_YES_1	Perfect!  This is exactly what I needed.</LB> And just like that... It's done!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_DONE_1	Thanks for your help!  Now we're going places!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_TOWN_TALK_REPEAT_1	I like it down here, Stranger.  The Docks are nice.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_TOWN_TALK_REPEAT_2	Can I take your order?</LB></LB>  Sorry, bad habit.  What's up, Stranger?	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_TOWN_TALK_REPEAT_3	I'll be heading back to the Kingdom soon.  Charon keeps taking my gold, but I don't mind.  I don't have anything to give, so they're just free rides.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_TOWN_TALK_REPEAT_4	I'll head back when you do.  There's still folks out there that need help.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_1	Mmmmm... Fightin' stopped long ago.  Royals won, always do.  Thought the celebration was a peace offering...</CR> The celebration was grand... Really put out all the stops.  I played for the people in the belly of a whale, but it turned out to be the mouth of a shark. ... Used my music to corral the people together, easy way to gather the insurgents.</CR> My friends, my family, my wife...  But they missed me.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_2	I was able to snag a Pizza Delivery job shortly after I decided I didn't want to be a farmer. </LB>  It was good pay, but more importantly, I could make my own hours, </LB> and it put me right smack dab in the center of Axis Mundi.</CR>  I delivered pizza to the hungry by day, and at night, I went to the Citadel so that I could</LB> feed my hungry mind.</LB> I studied under some of the best minds in the Kingdom and the teachers really took me under their wings.</LB> I guess there aren't many people down here with my zeal for geology y'know?  </CR>  But what really expanded my horizons were the deliveries. You know who orders pizza?  Everyone. </LB> Like, literally everyone likes pizza...</CR>  Every stratum of society orders pizza, from the wealthy and powerful, all the way down</LB> to those who have been forced into hiding because they can't pay the tolls anymore.  </LB></LB>    Pizza has given me the opportunity to see both sides of the story.</CR>   ... This is a stupid story isn't it.</LB> Like I bet you're sitting there thinking, 'did she pay someone to write this?'</LB> Well she didn't.  And it's true.</LB></LB>  Stupid stories can still be true you know...	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_3	Do you know how hard it is to deliver pizza to a place that keeps <color=blue>Shifting</color>? </LB> On rougher days, I used to used to wonder why I even bothered trying in the first place </CR>  But every trip I learned something new and I got better and better at tracking customers down.  Like I was strengthening my sixth sense.</CR>   That's when I stopped complaining about the world <color=blue>Shifting</color>, and started looking forwards to them.</LB>   If I could predict the <color=blue>Shift</color>, then maybe there was more to it than just randomness.</CR>  Like a well made pizza, there was a pattern to the shift. </LB> We didn't throw all the pepperoni's onto one slice, and likewise, the castle never had all the toilets end up in one wing.</CR>  It's why I started studying so hard at the Stygian Study.  My intuition was a gift, but I had to nurture it.</LB> Make myself truly understand what I knew on a subconscious level.</LB> If I could do then, then maybe I could do some actual lasting good with it.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_4	Did you know I was offered a job at the Stygian Studies?</CR>   They really treated me like a prodigy.  I turned them down though.</LB> Even though I could've studied all day, and probably be given all of the Red Aether I'd ever need,</LB> I'd probably end up being stuck doing someone else's work.</CR>  It's crazy, turning a job like that to stay as a Pizza Delivery Person.  But I didn't want anything tying me down to the Citadel.</LB> I wanna help the people, and delivering Pizza helped keep me grounded, y'know?  Felt like, if I left my job, I might lose my morals too...</CR>  Plus I'd lose out on all that free pizza!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_BUILD_REPEAT_1	I'm pooped. I'm just gonna sit here and eat some pizza.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_FINAL_STORY_1	I think that's it!  Every portal is now connected, which means we can reach everyone!</CR>  The kingdom is large and dangerous, but with this... We can do a lot of good.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_PORTAL_FINAL_REPEAT_1	*Whew*  It took a long time, and a lot of money, but it'll be worth it.  Thanks, hero.  </CR>  Want some pizza?

LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_INTRO_TALK_1	Pssst.  Pssst!</LB>... Wait, why am I whispering?</CR> Fella, can you help a sister out?</LB>Name's Bell, and I'm in a bit of a predic-ta-ment.</CR> I  triggered some kind of trap, and I've been stuck in here ever since.  There's a door nearby that will cut the energy source. </CR>Door's caved in, so you need to be pretty small... If you can't fit, d'you  have any children?  I really need your help!</CR> If you can free me I can totally help you out.  I'm an amateur archeologist by night, and a... Pizza delivery woman by day.   So I could let you in on my discovery, or I could get you 50% off on your next order!  Whatever you want man!  You gotta help me!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_INTRO_REPEAT_1	Please man, you gotta help me!  If I miss anymore shifts I'm gonna lose my Pizza Delivery job, and I'll be back to working the farms.</LB> You should be able to free me if you can enter that caved in door.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_SAVE_TALK_1	You did it, you got the doo-hickey!  That's amazing!  And just so y'know I don't think you're short at all!  I think you're awesome.</LB>Now please, free me!</CR> Free the Archeologist/Pizza Delivery Girl?	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_SAVE_CHOICE_1	Free the Archeologist/Pizza Delivery Girl?	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_SAVE_DENY_1	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</LB>Fella, you gotta let me go!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_SAVE_ACCEPT_1	OOOOOH BANGARANG!  Now to begin murdering everyone again!</CR> ... Just kidding, sorry being locked in that cage for so long has made me a little crazy.</CR> Anyways I found what I needed, I've got prrof that leylines exist!  They're real, and I detected them.  Me! A pizza girl!</CR> I gotta finish my shift first, but if you ever bump into me out there come give me a chat. I'll be around!</CR> Oh, and before I go, here's my business card.  Just in case!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_SAVE_ACCEPT_REPEAT_1	Hey, you go on ahead. I'm fine, I just wanna double check on some things before I bail.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_EXPLAIN_TALK_1	Hey again!  Thanks for freeing me back there.  I said I'd pay you back, and here we are!</CR>  Remember how I said I was onto something back at the castle?  Well I was examining leylines.  They're mystical energy sources that are embedded in the earth.</CR>  This world we live in, it's always changing. Rooms move around, buildings get shifted, heck, even entire pieces of land get shifted. But the leylines?   They're always the same.</CR>  I've been able to trace the energy from the leylines coming from these portals, and if I can get the resources I need, I can totally unlock this portal permanently!</LB> So whaddaya say?</CR>  I'll need {0} Red Aether and {1} gold to permanently unlock this teleporter.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_EXPLAIN_REPEAT_1	I'll need {0} Red Aether and {1} gold to permanently unlock this teleporter.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_NO_1	Oh, not interested?  That's ok... I've still got my Pizza job.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_FAIL_1	Oh... You don't have enough resources.  Sorry, I can't build it on hopes and dreams.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_YES_1	Perfect!  This is exactly what I needed.  Just give me a few minutes and I'll be able to build this.</LB> If you close your eyes, this'll make it easier for everyone.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_DONE_1	Annnd done.  Now you can teleport back even if you haven't found it yet.  The power of ley lines!	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_1	I used to be a farmer y'know.  It really got me interested in the earth.  Like, why does everything move?</CR>  I know that's not how it used to be, but we've been down here for so long I think everyone just took it for granted.</CR>  Made me wonder why I took my life for granted too...	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_2	I was able to snag a Pizza Delivery job shortly after I decided I didn't want to be a farmer.   It was good pay, but more importantly, it was shorter hours, and right in the center of StackTown.</CR>  It let me start taking night classes, and let me study up on Geology and everything that I was interested in!</CR>  But, I also got to see a lot more people... Y'know who orders pizza?  Yeah, it's a lot of lazy people... Like a LOT, but it was also the old, the feeble, and the sick.</CR>  These are people that'd be marked as rebels.  Those that have gone into hiding because they can't pay the tolls anymore.  The ones who are a weight on society.</CR>    We were always told that they were bad people, but they were just people who wanted to live.	
LOC_ID_DIALOGUE_TELEPORTER_NPC_OLD_PORTAL_BUILD_STORY_3	Do you know how hard it is to deliver pizza to a place if it keeps shifting?  I don't even know why we try in the first place </CR>  Delivery pizza is like a treasure hunt.  If the land shifts, you've gotta call the customer and they'd give you clues, and you'd have to find them.</CR>  But, after a while, I kept getting better and better at tracking the customer down.  Sort of like a sixth sense to how the world was moving.</CR>   That's when I stopped really caring about the WHY the world was shifting, and started looking into the WHERE.   If I could get a feel for it, then maybe there's more to it then just random chaos.</CR>  And if I could predict the chaos... Maybe I could actually do something really good in life.

\\	"When you Beat NG+ version of the skeleton boss, instead of Void Beast Defeated, it says
 Estuary Mehujael Defeated.
 
 And in the void beasts memory, we get a hidden memory. 
 
 Mehujael working in the Deep Mines meant he was cut off most from his siblings.  As such he gained a love for his people and considered them more important to his family then his fellow estuaries.
 
 That type of preferential treatment to peasants is akin to treason down here, so he never really brought it up.   
 
 When the water started to flood, and all of his people were drowning, Mehujael cut off pieces of himself, just like how Cain made his estuaries.  So a bunch of people were estuaries of an estuary.  
 
 It let them go out into the stygian 
  ocean, and resurface by the forest (losing many, many souls in the process).  They reingratiated the people there, and chose to live a new, normal life.
 
 
 When the rebellion began, Mehujael and a bunch of his followers joined on it, and finally died during the rebellion.
 
 Their bodies were then stacked at the bridge (current time) where mehujael then began to spread with the black rot and became the skeleton beast.  So even though people think it's a Void Beast, it's actually an estuary.
 
 
 A bunch of his followers didn't die, and they're the ones who snuck into the caves and threw Estuary Tubal into the Dragon because they found out from his memories that he had betrayed them, letting them all drown in the first place."

A monster has blocked the gates, and Irad won't send Lamech or any of the soldeirs to open the gates.  The Dragon is sick and he can't cure him.  Looks back as Murmur continues to attempt to extract a poison from the black roots. 3. The poison is wracking his body.  Murmur has fled, turned into a monster.  He has only one chance left, to flee his body, and place it in a chest.  But he doesn't want to do it.  He hacks away at the black root, tearing it in frustration.  All the way to the root, where the black root becomes a knot. He looks once more at his hand now black and gnarled like the root.  He grasps the knot, and feels himself being pulled. 4. He feels himself being pulled. His mind, detaching from his body. He sees the root does not end in a knot. It's a hole. A whole that they cannot comprehend. THe black root is massive, longer then he could possibly imagine, it twists and it turns, and it splits into a thousand other roots.  Travelling across dozens of other worlds.  Worlds layered ontop of theirs, similar yet so very different.   All the roots lead to the white tree. The tree in the garden.  But there is only one tree, existing in all dimensions. In other dimensions the seed bears fruit, but in theres it lies barren.  He sees a fruit fall, splitting open as it touches the ground.  And inside it lays a small child, completely black, the sun doesn't touch it's skin.  The only discernable feature are it's deep red eyes.

That the reason the roots end in knots is because they are wrapping themselves through multiple dimensions, all with their own gods, and rules, and variations of how the world works.

MAYBE CUT   2: Irad bowing to the King as he is lowered down into the River Styx.  He goes down with the last contingent of soldiers to begin  leading the construction of the Kingdom of Genesis under order of his king. Before going down, he meets in secret with his second-in-command, General Jubal, handing him a sealed letter. A way to contact him, in case of emergencies.  3. A letter drops from the sky into his hand. He opens it up revealing a letter from Jubal. civil war above, and King's still trying to expand.  Needs help. massive chart listing out the wars happening above, and a letter of plea from General Jubal for help. Passion ignites in him as he charts out weakpoints and strategies to take down the oppressors. Cain climbs up to the bell of return, and taps it ever so slightly.  A series of impercitble taps on the bell.  Almost imperceptible.  Enough to transmit a message to the loyal guards above.  4. Like clockwork, the messages kept coming. New worlds to conquer, new armies to command. Irad becomes addicted, until one day the messages stop... After many years, Irad sens a message above asking what has happened.  After many more days a message finally arrives.  Dear Irad, please show respect that you would give to your other equals. Estuary Jubal is currently preoccupied being the right hand of the King.  He is no longer able to humor your messages, and all future correspondances will go through us.  5. For months, Irad rages, but has to keep it bottled inside. It ate away at him. Until he one day gets a message with a carefully wrapped box.  He puts the letter down and a smile creeps on his face.  Estuary Jubal is dead. Slain by an unknown assailant. They have searched for months but have no clue.  The assassins left only a single gauntlet behind. They ask if they know what country it is from.  Irad looks down at the gauntlet.  A broken device, not meant for human hands.  One he's seen many of as he looks down upon Tubal's army of flying automatons.  A coincidence perhaps?  Yes... A coincidence.  He writes a message and tells the people above he has never seen a gauntlet like this before.  And... To speak to him with respect. He is an estuary after all...  6. The rebellion rages on, and everythings burning.  His tower is under siege as the rebels lay waste to the sun Tower's foundation.  Stuck up here, he cannot help as the rebels siege across Axis Mundi unimpeded. He directs as best he can but his men cannot free the entrance.  Beside him, a pile of un read reports from his spies lay on the table.  Notes of suspecious activites over the years which he ignored. The rebels keep fighting and through it all, the Automatons lie motionless...  6. He can't remember what he said, all he could remember was the screaming.  Naamah confronted him, blamed him for not catching onto the rebels soon enough and he snapped. He was busy conquering worlds, while they sat down here insipidly. Do they expect him to tend to 2 worlds? He put her in her place.   These estuaries are useless NaamThe rebellion finally quashed, Irad 4. The letters come fast and furies over the next hundred years, and the victories begin to amass as their King begins to conquer new worlds across the ocean.3.

But by harnessing the dragon's exothermic abilities, we can generate heat and distribute warmth throughout the Kingdom, and create steam to produce power.</CR>  <color=blue>Ladon's</color> den below the <color=blue>Gihon Reservoir</color> has the added benefit of speeding up evaporation, ensuring a frequent and consistent rain cycle across the <color=blue>Kerguelen Plateau</color>.</LB></LB>   Altogether, a truly remarkable system.</CR>   Alas, this explains why after the dragon fell ill, the biosphere slipped into complete disarray.  And unless it recovers, I fear the <color=blue>Kerguelen Plateau</color> will continue to freeze.</LB>  Unfortunately, there are no previous records of a dragon ever becoming ill!</LB> Their internal body temperature is so high, it was believed no disease could survive within them.</LB></LB>  It falls on me to find a cure... but how can I help if I do not even know what ails it?

The ash is denser, and extremely conductive.</LB> Like storm clouds they generate incredible amounts of electricity, but their frequent discharges are tearing away the <color=blue>Sun Tower</color>.</CR>   It is, however, theoretically possible to pull the electricity from the clouds via grounding poles, which could prove to be a limitless source of energy!</LB></LB>  A full reconstruction of the Citadel would be necessary to harness this power, which would take many years.</LB></LB>  I shall start my experiments within the Study, and if all goes well, I will expand operations to the Citadel.

Understanding its connection to the shared subconscious only partly helped in finding a solution.</LB></LB>   The full answer hit me after examining Lamech's hidden chamber in the <color=blue>Tower of Lights</color>.</CR>   I asked myself, 'what was it that anchored his hidden chamber to the room that hid it?'</LB></LB>  All I had to do was turn around for the answer to become clear.</CR>   It is the unique portal shared by both rooms that makes them unmistakable and unforgettable to the shared subconscious, thus they are anchored together!

I posit that the King, having consumed the last fruit from the Tree of Life, has become that place of return.  The souls of the dead are diverted away from the river, and towards him instead.</LB></LB>  It explains the King's longevity.  He is feeding upon the deaths of his subjects, their children, and their children's children.  He has become their purgatory.</CR>   Now as <color=blue>Estuaries</color>, we have partaken from his flesh and thus share in his immortal life.</LB> We are now part of our King... so it follows that when we die, a part of the King dies too.</LB> And once released, those souls siphoned by the King can finally return to the Tree...</CR>   </LB></LB></LB>   ...</LB> ...

The mist flows into the urn, mixing with the vapours within.)</CR>   (He quickly reseals the urn, then begins to rock it in his arms, cradling it as if a newborn.</LB> The urn's purple hue slowly fades away like a sick pallor, first turning gray, then white, then finally becoming black as pitch.</LB></LB>  Content with this mixture, <color=blue>Tubal</color> turns back to his worktable, and carefully slides the urn into the gauntlet's fitted hollow.)</CR>  (The urn suddenly cracks, and wisps of black smoke begin to seep out.

The <color=blue>Estuaries</color> won't approve of this...</CR>  Sometimes I wonder if they want the people to starve...</LB></LB>  But that is not the issue here.</LB></LB>  Perhaps by doing this, we can begin to atone for our past.

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_TITLE_1	Lady Quinn	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_INTRO_1	H-h-hello!  This is a nifty place you have here!</LB></LB>  M-m-my name is Lady Quinn, and I'm excited to meet you!</CR>  I-I-I'm a <color=blue>Living Dummy</color> and I knoooooow everything about <color=blue>Weapons</color> and stuff!</LB> I love everything about them, so if you have any questions, j-j-just ask!  I could talk your b-butt off about 'em!</LB></LB>  And who knows?  M-m-maybe you could learn a trick or t-two!</CR>  A-a-and s-s-sorry about the <color=blue>st-st-stu-stutter</color>.</LB> It gets worse when I'm f-f-feeling... <size=75%>shy</size>...</CR>  ......</LB></LB> ... Ok.  Well, nice t-t-talking to you!   	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_DEALING_MAX_DAMAGE_1	... Stop that.	
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_KNIGHT_SWORD_MOVE_1	Swords are the best.  You know why?  C-c-c-cause they're versatile!</LB></LB>  You can move and attack at the same time.  Try swinging then walk backwards right away to avoid a retaliatory attack!</LB> I call that move the <color=purple>B-b-buttslash</color>.</CR>  Oops!  I-I-I meant to say <color=purple>b-backslash</color>.</LB></LB>  ... M-m-m-moooving and attacking is s-s-slickety slick.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_KNIGHT_SWORD_DASH_1	Hey, that's a cool Sword a-and Shield you got there!</LB> It looks good on you!</LB></LB>  If y-y-you <color=purple>Dash</color> and attack you'll deal extra damage!  Cool, huh?</LB> You can tell if you've done it right when your slash changes color!</CR>   ... Y-y-y-yeaaaaah.  <color=purple>Dash Attacks</color> are as cooool as cucumbers.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_KNIGHT_BLOCK_PERFECT_1	I'm a big fan of Shields!</LB></LB>  You can hold the Shield up f-f-for as long as you want, but if you <color=yellow>Block</color> at the last moment, you'll do a <color=yellow>Perfect Block</color>!</LB> This blocks waaaaay more damage!</CR>  ... <color=yellow>P-p-p-perfect Blocks</color> are neat beans.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_KNIGHT_BLOCK_FREE_1	Pro tip: B-b-blocking is free!  I'm not you, but if I were, I'd practice spamming it right now!</LB></LB>  I won't attack you <size=75%>(that's too scary)</size>, but just doing the action r-r-really helps build up the m-m-muscle memory!	
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ARCHER_BOW_AIR_1	Oooooh, I-I-I love Rangers!  Bows are one of my favourite weapons!</LB></LB>  B-b-bows are built for power, so if you shoot while airborne, expect a lot of push-back.</CR>  BUT that also means if you shoot downwards while airborne, y-y-you can technically keep yourself afloat!</LB> Trust me on this one.</LB></LB>  <size=75%>(Science is complicated, so try not to think about it t-too much.)</size>	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ARCHER_PLATFORM_SPORE_1	D-d-don't forget to create <color=purple>Ivy Platforms</color> in the heat of b-b-battle!</LB> They're a great perch to aim from, and can save you if you fall into a pit of sp-sp-spikes.  Plus it only takes a few seconds to charge back up!</CR>  It's also helpful to know that firing an a-arrow while standing on an <color=purple>Ivy Platform</color> will inflict <color=purple>Spore Burst</color> on enemies.</LB> These are great for clearing out lots of b-b-b-butt guys!  I mean bad guys.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ARCHER_DASH_CANCEL_1	Don't forget, shooting an arrow is s-s-s-slow, but you can always <color=purple>Dash</color> away early!</LB></LB>  I-I-I call it the <color=purple>Dash Cancel</color>, and you can do it with a lot of stuff.  It's great!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ARCHER_SPIN_KICK_1	The best Rangers are the mobile ones!</LB> If you're really confident, it's b-b-best to a-always be in the air!</LB></LB>  M-m-mix Bow shots with <color=purple>Spin Kicks</color> and you can be in the air forever!</CR>  Plus you'll look super cool while doing it!	
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARBARIAN_AXE_AIR_1	T-T-T-THAT'S A BIG AXE!</LB></LB>  It's so heavy you can't swing it the same way in the air as on the ground.</CR>  But I l-love s-s-swinging it in the air, because its momentum makes you spin!  It can deal a lot if done correctly, especially if you use it while <color=purple>Dashing</color>.</LB> The Axe's heft means you have to commit to every swing, but you w-w-wanna know a cool trick?</LB> If you make a <color=red>R</color><color=orange>a</color><color=yellow>i</color><color=green>n</color><color=blue>b</color><color=purple>o</color> <color=#ff008a>w</color> arc over enemies while spinning, you can hit them like a gajillion times.</CR>  I-I-I-I call that move the... <color=red>R</color><color=orange>a</color><color=yellow>i</color><color=green>n</color><color=blue>b</color><color=purple>o</color><color=#ff008a>w</color> <color=purple>Slash</color>...</LB></LB>  Because you RAIN down the pain.</CR>  And it's pretty. 	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARBARIAN_AXE_GROUND_1	That bad Axe is super strong, and when swung on the ground it'll c-c-cleave through enemies!</LB></LB>  Also, hitting enemies with your ground swing is how the Barbarian recovers Mana, so don't spend all your time in the air!</CR>  If you feel like you're too s-slow and v-v-vulnerable while swinging on the ground, just remember your <color=purple>Dash</color> is instant.</LB></LB>  So use it to attack and dodge away quickly!  	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARBARIAN_SHOUT_FREEZE_1	Your <color=yellow>Sh-shout</color> is amazing!  It destroys all projectiles and <color=purple>F-f-f-freezes</color> nearby enemies.</LB></LB>  Plus, it works instantly, so cast it whenever you're in a bind!</CR>   And the b-b-best p-p-part about it?</LB> It charges up whenever you get hit, so make sure to use it to exact revenge!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARBARIAN_AXE_AIR_CHIP_HIT_1	Here's a small little neat-o tidbit.</LB> When you l-land from a spinning attack, you knockback enemies in a small radius around you.</LB></LB>  It's just a small thing to keep in mind, but still... p-pretty cool.	
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_MAGE_MANA_LEECH_1	That Wand looks m-m-mystical!  I-I-I love these things!</LB></LB>  If I were a Mage, I'd be casting spells ALL THE TIME.</CR>  Y-y-your Wand itself doesn't deal a lot, but enemies hit with its explosion will take extra damage!</LB></LB> Hitting baddies as a Mage causes <color=purple>M-m-m-mana Leech</color>, which siphons Mana from afflicted enemies.  But what's better is any foe defeated while being leeched will give you a B-B-BURST OF MANA.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_MAGE_DOUBLE_HIT_1	If your Wand's fireball hits an enemy before it explodes, it'll hit t-t-twice!</LB></LB>  So position yourself at the right distance when you strike, and you'll deal E-E-E-EXTRA DAMAGE!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_MAGE_SPELL_VARIETY_1	A M-m-mage always has two different spells: O-one is utility, the other is offensive.</LB></LB>  It's pretty neat how they work together.</CR>  Just remember, your <color=purple>M-m-m-mana Leech</color> lasts a really long t-t-time.  It might even be t-t-tough to keep all that Mana on hand.</LB> So if you're fighting a really big baddie, make sure to keep casting your spells!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_MAGE_MIXING_1	If you m-m-mix your regular attacks with your s-s-spells, you'll never run out of Mana.</LB> The trick is to hit an enemy with your basic attack, a-and then finish them off with a spell.</CR>  Once you get into a nice groove, you'll able to shoot multiple spells f-for each a-a-attack.</LB></LB> G-g-getting used to how many spells you can cast is the tricky p-part, but you'll quickly get a feel for it! 	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_MAGE_MANA_LEECH_TARGET_1	You can also <color=purple>M-m-m-mana Leech</color> strategically.</LB> <color=purple>Mana Leech</color> enemies who can't hit you, th-then use their Mana to shoot spells at more dangerous baddies!</CR>  And if your spells cost a l-l-lot of Mana, just remember you can leech multiple enemies at the same time! 	
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SPEAR_DIRECTION_1	H-h-hey!  It's a Valkyrie!</LB></LB>  Your weapon is super versatile.  Did you know that you can attack in four different directions?</LB> Up, left, down, and r-r-r-r-reft.  <size=75%>Sorry, I meant right.</size></CR>  The trade-off is that it's a bit clunky, so your attack speed is a LITTTTLE slower.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SPEAR_COUNTER_RESET_1	The <color=purple>Valkyrie</color> has one of the coolest moves ever: <color=purple>Deflect</color>!</LB></LB> Correctly timing <color=purple>Deflect</color> requires precision, but if done correctly it will knock away a-a-a-almost any projectile.  <size=75%>As long as they're not too big.</size></CR>  P-p-plus, every time you successfully <color=purple>Deflect</color> a projectile, your cooldown resets!  So if you're really good, you can <color=purple>Deflect</color> forever!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SPEAR_COUNTER_MANA_1	<color=purple>Deflecting</color> projectiles also gives you <color=blue>Mana</color>.</LB> It's crazy how powerful it is.</CR>  So if you're fighting a Flamelock, you can just <color=purple>Deflect</color> everything and get ALL your Mana back SUPER FAST!  It's th-th-that good!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SPEAR_BOUNCE_1	Did you notice if you hit an enemy f-f-from above with a downward swing, you will actually b-b-bounce up into the sky?</LB></LB>  The bounce height is almost the s-s-same as a <color=purple>Spin Kick</color>.</CR>  Here's a cool trick if y-y-y-you're really confident:</LB></LB> Downstrike an enemy, then <color=purple>Spin Kick</color> right away to deal extra damage!	
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_COOK_ATTACK_REFLECT_1	H-h-hello Chef!  Ready to r-r-roast some bad guys?</LB>  You may not b-b-be as strong as other heroes, but what your Frying Pan lacks in damage it makes up for in utility!</CR>  Did you know you can strike most projectiles and send them back at your enemies?  Crazy right?  Just avoid the s-s-super big ones.</LB></LB>  And s-s-serving up a fireball sandwich doesn't just look cool.  You'll d-deal extra damage on your next attack.</CR>  Chefs can also c-cook anything at any t-time, so attacking with any w-weapon will <color=purple>Burn</color> baddies.</LB></LB>  So d-don't be afraid to charge straight for ranged enemies - they should be afraid of you!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_COOK_HEAL_1	The Frying Pan is pretty cool, but if you a-a-ask me, it's all about the POT!</LB></LB>  Whip it out to cook nourishing meals on-the-go when you're low on Health.</CR>  Your <color=purple>Cook</color> ability lets you do this in a flash, making Chefs one of the most durable classes out there.</LB> Plus, it holds m-m-multiple charges!</CR>  Your Pot refills b-b-by picking up <color=purple>Health Drops</color>, so it pays to p-p-p-plunder!    	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_COOK_MANA_1	Like Mages, the Chef is all about <color=purple>Intelligence</color>.</LB> So maxing out your <color=purple>Strength</color> won't do you much good.</CR>  Your Frying Pan m-m-m-may improve with <color=purple>Strength</color>, but everything else needs <color=purple>Intelligence</color>.</LB></LB>  This means your <color=purple>Spells</color>, <color=purple>Cooking</color>, and <color=purple>Reflected Fireballs</color> all use <color=purple>Intelligence</color>.</LB>  But remember, all classes get some benefits from every stat, so make sure you treat everyone fairly while you're building that giant manor of yours!

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SABER_INTRO_1	O-o-o-ohhhh yeah, now we're talking!  Duelists puts the 'c-c-class' in 'c-c-c-lassy'!!!</LB></LB>  You never h-h-have to worry about Health if you n-n-never get hit! </CR>  They move fast, attack faster, and did I mention they can ROLL?</LB> You can roll a-a-almost all the time, so if you're just w-w-walking you're just chumpin'. 	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SABER_VERTICAL_ATTACK_1	Duelists h-h-have a bit of trouble with enemies in the a-a-ir, but if you hold Hold [MoveVertical] Up and press [Attack] you'll do a <color=blue>Vertical Swing</color>.</LB></LB>  Great for p-p-poking enemies in j-j-just out of reach!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SABER_BASIC_COMBO_1	If you don't want to get stomped you'll need to master the Saber, your bread and b-b-b-butts <size=75%>(I mean butter)</size>. </LB></LB>  If you're in the air, the Saber does a <color=blue>Swing</color> attack.</LB> If you're on the ground, the Saber does a <color=blue>Lunge</color> attack.</CR>   The nifty thing is <color=blue>s-s-s-swings</color> can quickly transition into <color=blue>l-l-lunges</color>.</LB> So if you attack just before you land, you can immediately l-l-launch another attack the moment you t-t-touch ground.  This will D-D-D-DOUBLE YOUR DAMAGE!</CR>   This will be your most basic combo, so make sure you practice to become a sw-unging pro!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SABER_ROLL_1	D-D-D-Duelists can also do a <color=purple>Combat Roll</color>.  While r-r-rolling you'll dodge all enemy attacks.</LB> Plus you'll knock back enemies if you b-b-bump into them!</CR>  The <color=purple>Combat Roll</color> also recharges very q-q-quickly!  So roll like your life depends on it (I-i-it probably does)!</LB> And there's one more cool secret.  If you perform an <color=purple>Air D-d-dash</color> and a <color=purple>Combat Roll</color> at the same time, you can do a <color=purple>Combat Dash Roll</color>.</LB> It's like a roll without the g-g-g-gravity!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_SABER_ROLL_COMBO_1	Did you know you can break out of y-y-your <color=purple>Combat Roll</color> with a L-l-lunge?</LB> With this, things c-c-can get really crazy!</CR>  You can Swing into a Lunge into a Roll into another Lunge for more than TRIPLE the d-d-damage!</LB></LB> It's a little t-t-tough to pull off, but with a bit of practice you'll become a s-lun-ol-ging pro!

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_DUALBLADES_INTRO_1	L-l-lookin' spooky!</LB> Assassins scare me because of their speed and damage!</LB></LB>  If you wanna get in-and-out, nothin' b-b-beats Assassins with their Dual Blades and their shadowy <color=blue>Cloaks</color>.</CR>  Assassins may be squishy, b-but if you get the hang of them you can wipe out most enemies before they have a chance to strike.  	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_DUALBLADES_CRITSTRIKE_1	You know that famous third strike of yours?</LB> Not only does it deal heavy damage and always <color=purple>Skill Crits</color>, but it reduces the cooldown on your <color=blue>Talent</color> too!</LB> So if there's any attack y-y-you wanna land, that's the one.</CR>  And don't forget, the Assassin can move while attacking.  So don't stand there like a chump!  You gotta always be moving!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_DUALBLADES_CLOAK_1	When you're <color=purple>Cloaked</color> nothing can hurt you, not e-even spikes!  So don't waste it trying to avoid minor scratches.</CR>  You also get a speed boost while you're stealthed.  The b-best Assassins will use their <color=blue>Cloak</color> to give them the high ground, avoid nasty obstacles, or just give themselves some space to think.</CR>  And if you want to get extra c-c-crazy, if you break your <color=blue>Cloak</color> with an attack, you'll m-make enemies <color=blue>Vulnerable</color> for some spicy damage!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_DUALBLADES_DASH_ATTACK_1	Did'ja know, all <color=purple>Skill Crits</color> can turn into <color=purple>Super Crits</color>?</LB> The odds of g-getting a <color=purple>Super Crit</color> are low, but the Assassin's passive gives them a higher chance!</LB></LB>  Imagine dashing into your e-enemy, landing all three strikes, AND landing a <color=purple>Super Crit</color> at the end!!!</LB> Now that's one spicy p-p-pizza.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_DUALBLADES_MANA_1	With two blades, Assassins can build up Mana real quick.</LB> So if you're not casting spells, you're missing out on how v-v-versatile they are!  </LB></LB>  So start lobbin' that Magic!

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_GUNSLINGER_INTRO_1	H-h-howdy there Hot Stuff!  Sorry, I can't stop lookin' at your get-up.</CR>  Gunslingers seem to be the best at everything!  They're fast, they deal a bunch of damage, and they look c-c-cool reloading their Pistol!</LB></LB>  In fact, they're so suave they deal bonus damage with any weapon they use based on their <color=blue>Intelligence</color>.  	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_GUNSLINGER_DASH_1	A Gunslinger's best friend is that Pistol there.  You wanna know what their next best friend is?</CR>  Here's a hint:</LB> Every time you shoot your Pistol you're stuck in place, making you an easy target.</LB> So what c-c-can you do to get yourself out of a tight spot?</CR>  If you said your next best friend is your <color=purple>Dash</color>, you're r-r-right! </LB> ... But also wr-wr-wrong.</CR>  The c-c-c-correct answer is the <color=blue>Enchantress</color> because I heard she can give you an extra <color=purple>Dash</color>.</LB></LB>  <size=75%>S-s-s-sorry.</size>	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_GUNSLINGER_AMMO_1	A Gunslinger's greatest weakness is their limited ammo.</LB> Reloading makes you v-v-vulnerable, but that's where your second-best friend comes in!  You can <color=purple>Dash</color> away while reloading!</CR>  Y-y-you can wait until the gun chamber is empty then attack again to reload, or you can reload early with the USE button.</LB> It's smart to p-p-plan ahead and reload when you're safe, but risky Gunslingers will be rewarded for using their f-full clip.  Neat huh?	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_GUNSLINGER_ALTERNATE_RELOAD_1	D-d-did you know there's 3 different ways to reload your gun?</LB> When you run out of ammo, you can reload by pressing attack again while you're empty.</LB> You can also use your t-t-talent to reload at any time!</LB> Finally, you can press your USE button at any time to reload as well!  Neat huh?	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_GUNSLINGER_AIR_1	Want to know a cool b-b-bit of science?  If you fire your Pistol while in the air, you can keep yourself afloat.</LB> As long as you hold down the trigger you can stay afloat, even if you run out of ammo!</CR>  So disrespect the l-l-laws of physics and hold that button down!

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_LANCE_INTRO_1	Ooooh, you're a Dragon Lancer!</LB></LB>  Dragon Lancers are the coooooolest.  I know I say that a lot, but I mean it!</CR>  They're neat because they have t-t-two different primary attacks!</LB></LB>  Press <color=blue>Attack</color> to do a <color=blue>Back Blast</color>.  This will give your enemies a steam bath!</LB> Hold <color=blue>Attack</color> to charge y-y-your Lance and do a <color=blue>Flying Joust</color>!</CR>  It's called 'flying' for a reason!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_LANCE_CONTROL_MOVEMENT_1	Did you know you can move while doing a <color=blue>Flying Joust</color>?</LB></LB>  Y-you're surprisingly mobile while airborne, so if an enemy shoots a p-projectile at you, simply swerve around it!</CR>   As a Lancer, you should n-n-never forget this golden rule:</LB> 'Those who go straight, will end up as bait.'</CR>  'Those who swerve 'round....</LB> ... <size=75%>won't...'</size></CR>  It rhymes, so it must be true!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_LANCE_MAGIC_AND_STRENGTH_1	Your <color=blue>Flying Joust</color> is way stronger than the <color=blue>Back Blast</color>.</LB></LB>  ... Like, WAY stronger.</CR>  And if you're not seeing a-a-a big damage increase, it's probably because your <color=purple>Intelligence</color> is low.</LB></LB>  The Charge Lance is one of the few weapons that scales with both <color=purple>Strength</color> and <color=purple>Intelligence</color>!</LB> So it may be time t-t-to hit the books, because a balanced Lancer build works b-best!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_LANCE_BLAST_BACK_DODGE_CANCEL_1	Y-your Lance's <color=blue>Back Blast</color> isn't meant to deal damage.</LB> It's mostly there to get aggressive enemies off your back!</CR>  The best thing about the <color=blue>Back Blast</color> is that it pushes you away from enemies,</LB> so m-make sure you take that into account!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_LANCE_TALENT_FREE_CAST_1	The Dragon Lancer's <color=purple>Bastion</color> Talent creates a wall in the direction you're facing.</LB> It blocks a LOT of p-p-projectiles and has no casting time, so just like the Barbarian's Shout, cast it whenever you need it!</CR>  Personally, I think the b-best time to cast it is while you're in a <color=purple>Flying Joust</color>.</LB>

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BOXER_INTRO_1	No one can go toe-to-toe with a B-B-Boxer!</LB> <size=75%>(... Probably because everyone else uses weapons...)</size></CR>  But seriously, when in doubt, your fists are your m-m-most reliable weapon.</LB> Not only that, but Boxers are super athletic and can dip and d-d-dive between enemies.  If the opponent isn't attacking, Boxers can slip right past them.</CR>  ... Plus you can throw people!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BOXER_COMBO_1	The Boxer is all about <color=purple>Combos</color>!</LB> The more hits you land, the more <color=purple>Combos</color> you'll stack!</LB></LB>  Each stack increases the damage you deal, so get in there and start wailing!</CR>   And if you're f-feeling tired, you can always hold d-down the attack.  It's j-just as fast as tapping!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BOXER_THROWING_1	Even at m-m-max <color=purple>Combo</color> stacks, you won't deal a lot with just your jabs.</LB> But that's okay because you can always end the fight with a <color=purple>KNOCKOUT PUNCH</color>!</CR>  This finisher lets you smack baddies into other baddies.</LB> The more <color=purple>Combo</color> stacks you've gained, the m-more damage y-you'll deal to your foes and the enemies they collide with!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BOXER_AIMING_1	While the rhythm of punching and knocking out enemies feels g-g-great, you should always take your time with your attacks.</LB></LB>  Your <color=purple>Knockout Punch</color> c-can be aimed, so be sure to make the most of it.</LB> Knock enemies a safe distance away, or towards hard-to-reach targets.</CR>  And d-d-don't w-worry about throwing enemies behind you.</LB>  As long as they're flying, they can't hurt you!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BOXER_UPPERCUT_1	S-sometimes you need a better angle when knocking f-f-fools around!</LB> For that, I recommend the uppercut!</LB></LB>  Hold UP while attacking to s-send enemies sky high!</CR>  This way you can position them to c-c-c-crash into other enemies, or just go for a s-sweet aerial combo.	
\\		
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_RONIN_INTRO_1	Oooooh!  A Ronin!  I w-w-wish I had a straw hat!</LB>  Ronins are the masters of spacing.  M-make the most of your massive range, and turn enemies into b-b-bite-sized bits from afar!</CR>  Sure, you can still hit foes that are close to you, but w-where's the fun in that?	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_RONIN_ANGLE_1	D-did you know you can angle your slice as a Ronin?</LB> It's great for hitting things slightly above and b-below you.</LB></LB>  Ronins have to always look cool, so they take a long time to sheathe their MASSIVE Katanas.  But they can move while sheathing in the air, so it pays to s-s-stay airborne.</CR>  Keep your distance, stay in the air, and angle your w-weapon to really be effective! 	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_RONIN_CRIT_1	If you hit with the t-tip of your blade you'll l-land a <color=purple>Skill Crit</color>!</LB> Keep yourself in that sweet spot and you'll dish out a t-t-ton of damage!</CR>  Wanna know a cool trick?</LB> If you attack in the air you can m-m-m-move and drag your blade into enemies for easy <color=purple>Skill Crits</color>.</LB> Ch-cheesy?  I think not!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_RONIN_TELESLICE_1	Don't forget to use your Talent, <color=purple>Immortal Kotetsu</color>.</LB> Sure it sounds cool, but it looks even c-c-cooler!</LB></LB>  It will teleport you a super long distance, and though it can't go through walls, it will slash anything in-between.</CR>  You can aim it too, so it's a great way of g-g-getting out of trouble.  Or into it, you sly d-d-dog.</CR>  Just be careful where you end up, b-b-because there's no immunity window afterwards.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_RONIN_DASH_CANCEL_1	D-don't forget to <color=purple>Dash</color>!</LB> If you <color=purple>Dash</color> after attacking you c-can actually swing faster than just sticking a-around like a ch-chump.</CR>  R-R-Ronin's are deceptively fast, so get zippin'!

\\		
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARD_INTRO_1	Oh, so you're a Bard this time!  You might not be cool looking, but you're still one of my favourites!</LB></LB>  Bards are great if you love to i-i-improvise.  They sing and dance and prance about, which means they're constantly moving and are d-difficult to m-master!</CR>  Bards deal damage in a very d-d-different way than other classes, so if you h-haven't mastered the <color=purple>Spin Kick</color> y-you should take it slow.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARD_EXPLODING_NOTE_1	D-did you know that you can bounce off your own notes by kicking them?</LB> If you do, they'll e-e-explode!</CR>  And those explosion's aren't just for s-show.</LB> They're way s-s-stronger than just dealing damage with the n-notes on their own!</LB>  And don't w-worry, the notes don't disappear after exploding, so you can keep bouncing on the same note for as long as it's around!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARD_DANCE_1	A b-b-big part of the Bard is keeping the groove goin'.  If you <color=purple>Spin Kick</color> off your audience, you'll build up <color=purple>Dance</color> stacks.</LB></LB>  The more <color=purple>Dance</color> y-you have, the more bonus <color=purple>Magic Damage</color> you'll do.</LB> This is great, because when your notes explode they also deal <color=purple>Magic Damage</color>!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARD_DANCE_ADVANCED_1	Y-you only build up <color=purple>Dance</color> if you <color=purple>Spin Kick</color> an enemy, and you lose it all when you t-touch the g-g-ground.</LB></LB>  So keep those feet up!</CR>  Here's another secret.  If you kick a n-note and the explosion hits an enemy, you'll also gain <color=purple>Dance</color>.</LB> Neat-o, right?</LB></LB>  You can also keep bouncing off notes to a-a-avoid losing the <color=purple>Dance</color> stacks you already have.</LB> Double neat-o!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARD_CLIMB_1	W-w-wanna get high?  If y-you're good at it, you can use your Lute to reach any height you want! </LB> Just shoot notes to your s-side, then <color=purple>Dash</color> to them and kick off!</CR>  People in the know call that little technique 'Scaling'.</LB></LB>  ... I like b-b-being in the know.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_BARD_CRESCENDO_1	Don't f-forget to use your <color=blue>Crescendo</color> Talent!  It will transform all m-m-mid-sized projectiles coming at you into musical notes.</LB></LB>  It's a great way to turn the t-t-tides!</CR>  You can use it to avoid an incoming attack or to g-give yourself more notes to p-play with!</LB></LB>  The only limit is y-your imagination.</LB> <size=75%>(And the cooldown.)</size>

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_PIRATE_INTRO_1	Oooooh!  Yarrrrr!  I lo-o-ove Pirates.</LB></LB>  Pirates have so many tricks up their sleeves that it's k-kinda tough to keep track of it all.</CR>  If you like having a l-l-lot of options, and fighting a little u-underhanded, then a Pirate's life is for you!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_PIRATE_WEAKNESS_COMBO_1	Know what the best thing a-about the Pirate's cannon is?  It's got a really strong knockback!</CR>  So knock foes back, and then follow up with a big 'ol cannon shot for a 1-2 combo!  Yarrrrr!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_PIRATE_DESTROY_PROJECTILES_1	Y-y-you can't move while swinging your cannon, but you can still dash!</LB></LB>  So don't just stand there, g-get moving! Pirates are squirrely, so get s-squirrlen.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_PIRATE_BOAT_MOVEMENT_1	I l-love the Pirate's little boat!  It's s-so versatile.  Try to use it often since it can pack quite a wallop!</LB></LB>  And don't forget, you can fly that b-b-bad girl while you're helming it!  Its range is crazy!</CR>  Oh and one more neat trick: If you activate the boat again, you can send it flying into your foes extra early!

LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ASTROMANCER_INTRO_1	Omigosh!  Are you an Astromancer?</LB></LB>  Astromancers are c-c-crazy!  They're so mobile, and hit in a huge area!  But if you're not using all your abilities, they're tough to handle.</CR>  If you're good at using your Attacks, Spells, and Talents in equal measure, the Astromancer can't be beat!</LB></LB>  But be careful!  Astromancers are squishy - even squishier than a Mage (no beard to absorb blows), so take care not to get knocked onto your butt.	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ASTROMANCER_MULTIPLE_TARGETS_1	Astromancers are all about fighting in m-m-multiple places at once. You can only have one B-blackhole open at a time, so there's no point in sticking around after m-making one!</LB></LB>  You should fire and forget.  Let the B-blackhole do it's thing while you go about b-blasting butts with your magic!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ASTROMANCER_PASSIVE_1	The Astromancer's passive is c-crazy powerful!  Any time you damage an enemy you generate Mana.</LB>  And I mean any damage!</LB></LB>  If you Spin Kick a foe you'll get Mana.  Poison an enemy, and you'll get Mana.  Land a Spell and you'll get Mana!  Everything gives you Mana!  It's great!</CR>  The Astromancer's passive means you do r-really well with Weapons and Spells that hit multiple times!</LB> Land a crazy Gravity Beam and you might even get more M-m-mana than you started with!	
LOC_ID_DUMMY_DIALOGUE_ASTROMANCER_COMET_1	You can become a Comet!  That's so c-c-c-coooool!</LB>  While you're a Comet, you can fly wherever you want, a-and you don't take damage!</CR>  It's really great for getting o-out of tight spots, and with your passive it generates a ton of Mana too!</LB> Don't be afraid to turn into a Comet often.  The cooldown can throw you off, so get used to the timing and you'll be able to rocket through space more often than you think!

LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_SMELLS_1	Ain't nothing quite like the smell of a forge in full bellow, Kid.</LB></LB>  The coal, the melted iron, the sweat...  smells like memories.</CR>   ... It also smells a little toxic, if I'm gonna be honest.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_ALL_MY_LIFE_1	I've been a blacksmith all my life, Kid.  Knew it'd be my passion the moment I first picked up a hammer.</LB></LB>  Some people feel bad for me, wonderin’ how I could spend my whole life doing the same thing over and over.</CR>  Truth is, I'm one of the lucky ones.</LB> So many people out there spend their whole life looking for purpose and never findin’ it.</LB></LB>  ... Just always lookin', and never commitin'...</CR>  Kid, what I'm tryin' to say is... you buying somethin’ or what? 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_FORGE_JOKE_1	Hey Kid, you headin' out?</LB> Well, be-forge you leave don't forge-t to buy something.</LB></LB>  Like that?  Bit o’ blacksmith humour right there. </CR>  ... Jokes aside, you should buy something.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_WORDS_AND_METALS_1	D'you know what words and smithing have in common?</LB> They get used, tempered, and rebuilt over the years, eventually becoming something new.</CR>  That armor you have?  One day it will be scrapped, melted, and reforged.</LB> Maybe a hundred years from now that sword'll be a really big spoon.</CR>  Words go through the same transformative process.</LB> They absorb new meanings as they are used in common parlance, and often become something entirely different.</CR>  ... I dunno why I'm acting like I knew this.  I'm just spittin' out what the Totem told me.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_WHITE_SMITH_1	Y'know, I'm not just a blacksmith.</CR>  I was trained in the crafting of large-scale items like armor, ploughs, and swords, but I learned the skills of a whitesmith too.</LB> Rings, fine tools, and etchings.</LB></LB>  Smithing isn't just a job to me.  It's my blood.  Everythin' I make, I put the utmost care into.</CR>  ... So stop complainin' about my prices. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_ENCHANTRESS_TALK_1	Been talkin' to that Enchantress friend o' yours.  She's quite the talker.</LB></LB>  Lovely as silver, but a talker.</CR>  Would be innerestin' to see if she could sit through one of the Architect’s tales without sayin' a thing. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_ENCHANTRESS_REPAIR_1	Fixed the Enchantress' crystal pole yesterday.</LB> Pretty easy.  Tightened some nuts and bolts, finished in an hour.</LB></LB>  Spent some time talkin' to her.  Ain’t so bad.</CR>  ... By the way, the hinges on the pole were loose ‘cause someone's been kickin' at it.</CR>  ... Wouldn’t mind if you kept it up.</LB> Be helpful to know I did a good job repairin' it.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_ENCHANTRESS_DATE_1	Kid, I'm lookin' for some advice.  That Enchantress friend of yours?</LB> Asked if I'd be interested in joinin' her for dinner.</CR>  What should I wear?  Alls I got is this apron.</LB></LB>  ... You think that's ok?</CR>  ... Maybe I should go shirtless?</LB> Forgot how hard this is.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_DELICIOUS_MEAL_1	Life’s funny, ain’t it Kid?</LB> The past ain’t been kind to me, so I came down here to start again.</LB></LB>  Wanted to give myself some time to be alone.</CR>  But that Enchantress is quite the lady.  Been a long time since I’ve felt this way.</LB> Maybe being alone ain’t what I need right now.</CR>  And she's one heck of a cook!  Never had such exotic food before.</LB> That Ful she made was somethin' else.</CR>  ... But to be honest, her Ham-borg-er was my favourite.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_HEADING_OUT_1	Hey Kid, looks like you're heading out again huh?</LB>
 Well, be careful out there.</CR>
 
 I've takin' a liking to you, so try and make it back y'hear?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_APPRENTICE_1	If you're tired of makin’ a living by dyin', I'm always on the lookout for an apprentice.</LB></LB>  You're small, got tiny arms, and you're clumsy as heck, but you've got a good head on your shoulders.</CR>   Never been happier than when I'm learnin'.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_MASTER_SMITH_1	You know, one of my goals in life was to earn the title of Mastersmith.</CR>  It's a title given to those who've shown mastery in all forms of smithing:</LB> Blacksmithing, whitesmithing, and leatherworks.</LB></LB>  ... Still think that last one shoulda been called cowsmithing.</CR>  To be a real master, you hafta forge from memory, without the help of blueprints.</LB></LB>  Never could pass the final test 'cause of my <color=blue>Aphantasia</color>.</CR>  I'm an old man, but even I think some customs are dated.</LB> No self-respectin' blacksmith would ever start workin' without a trusty blueprint beside 'em.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_FORMING_CORE_1	I may not be considered a mastersmith, but those weapons o’ yours were made with love and care.</LB></LB>  There are many steps to makin' a blade, but the most important one is forging a strong core.</CR>  If the blade is too hard, it'll shatter the moment you swing it.</LB> If the blade is too soft, it'll deform itself on the first thing it strikes.</LB></LB>  Remember, good blades bend, bad ones break. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_LIVING_SAFE_PIECES_1	Y'ever speak to that safe in the buoy?  I'm interested to know what it's made of.</LB> It spends all day sittin’ in the water, but it ain't rustin’.</CR>  Wonderin' if I can take a chip of it. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_COOKING_FOR_ENCHANTRESS_1	Hey Kid, y'know any good recipes?</LB></LB>  The Enchantress has been cooking for me all this time.</LB> Feel like I should return the favour, but I don't know how to cook.</CR>  I've also got no kitchen, so whatever recipe you have, it's gotta work in a forge that blasts at 1600 degrees. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_ARCHITECT_AGE_1	I wonder how old the Architect is?</LB> I'm hittin' 100, but he looks like he's over 10,000.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_WINDOW_SHOPPING_1	Still window shoppin' Kid?</LB></LB>  Can't make items if I don't have customers, is all I'm sayin'.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_PIZZA_GIRL_SLEEP_OVER_1	Been lettin' that Pizza Girl sleep in the forge.</LB> I have a spare room in the back that's well ventilated. </LB></LB>  Still gets dusty though.</CR>  It’s been good.  Doesn't make a lotta noise, and she helps clean up the place.</LB></LB>  ... Think she's been sneakin' about and usin' my forge to cook pizzas though.</CR>  I'd complain, but I do like pizza.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_STILL_LOOKING_FOR_APPRENTICE_1	Still goin' out there Kid?</LB></LB>  Well, I'm still lookin' for an apprentice, is all I'm sayin'.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_COME_FOR_DINNER_1	Hey Kid, you could use some meat on you. </CR>  You should come over for dinner some time.</LB> Nunet makes a delicious stew, and I can make some really, really burnt meat.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_ENCHANTRESS_GIFT_1	Hey Kid, I made Nunet a steel pillow.  Tell me what ya think.</LB></LB>  I tried to make it as soft as possible, but it's still really, really hard.</CR>  ... Honestly, you could probably use it as a weapon if you were in a pinch.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_FEEL_SORRY_ENCHANTRESS_1	That pillow I made for Nunet was a terrible idea.  Hurt her back tryin' to sleep on it.</CR>  She likes soft things but I'm a blacksmith.  Everythin' I make is gonna be hard.</LB> If I really wanna make her somethin' I can't just resort to what's comfortable for me, y'know?  I need to do better.</CR>  Seriously, a metal pillow...  What was I thinking?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_STABILIZING_TOWER_1	Those wooden beams behind me have been wigglin’.</LB> I've reinforced the base, so you can tell Quinn up there she can go back to her shenanigans again.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_HELP_WITH_APHANTASIA_1	Hey Kid, keep up the good work, y'hear?</LB></LB>  I thought I was alright livin' out my life down here, but I’ve got the itch to take the Mastersmith trial again.</CR>  Nunet has been helpin' me with my <color=blue>Aphantasia</color>.</LB> Just little things.  She's been tryin' to help me 'exercise my imagination'.</CR>  Not sure if it's workin', but just knowin' someone's in my corner makes me feel like givin' it another shot. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_CHARONS_SCYTHE_1	Hey Kid, ever peek under Charon's cloak?</LB></LB>  It's pitch black underneath, but I once caught a glimpse of his weapon.</CR>  Looked like a glowing white scythe.  It looked ethereal, like somethin' made from another world.</CR>  ... Would love to get my hands on whatever it's made from.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_LEARNING_HOW_TO_KNIT_1	 Hey Kid, sorry if I'm a bit slow today.</LB></LB>  Fingers are in a bit of a mess.</CR>  I took up knitting, and it's twisted up my fingers somethin' awful.</LB></LB>  Never thought something so soft could be so hard.  And painful!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_REASONS_FOR_KNITTING_1	Had to take a break from knitting.  It's exhaustin' work.</LB></LB>  Been tryin' to make the Enchantress a proper pillow, since the steel one wasn’t a great idea.</CR>  So far all I've been able to make is this tiny doily, and it's taken me days...</LB></LB>  ... this pillow'll take centuries.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_CHANGE_TO_BLANKET_1	I gave up on the pillow, too hard for me.</CR>  Instead, I made some glass beads and sewed them into Nunet's blanket.</LB> She has trouble sleepin' sometimes, but calms right down with a tight hug.</CR>  Made this weighted blanket to help her when I'm not around.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_HAPPY_DOCKS_1	There's somethin' special about this place Kid.</LB> Didn't expect anythin' when I settled here, but I'm glad I did.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_WEDDING_RING_1	Hey Kid, I was tryin' to keep this a secret but I planned on proposin' to Nunet.</LB> I was quietly makin’ a ring, but it's hard to hide somethin' from someone who’s right beside you...</CR>  ... I say I 'planned' on proposin' cause she didn't give me the chance.</LB> She said yes 'fore I even popped the question...</CR>  Sorry Kid, seems like I got some smoke in my eye.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_WHEN_TO_HOLD_WEDDING_1	Got no set time for the weddin'.  Thinkin' we'll do it when we all get out of here.</LB></LB>  That means you too, y'hear?  Don't go screwin' around too much, Kid.</CR>  ... You'll mess up our seatin' arrangements.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_WONDER_WHAT_WORLD_IS_LIKE_1	Time's crazy down here, Kid.</LB> It can't have been long, but sometimes it feels like ages since I first landed at these docks.</CR>  ... Wonder if I'm fallin' behind in the world of blacksmithin'.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_KEEP_BEING_GOOD_1	Hey Kid.  You keep bein' good y'hear?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_BLACKSMITH_REWARD_1	Hey Kid, I just wanna say thanks for listenin' to me ramble on all these days.</LB></LB>  I've grown a lot down here... And even though everythin' good in my life started here, I can't wait to leave.</CR>  ... I've got some of these <color=blue>Soul Stones</color> that I've had layin' around for who knows how long.</LB> Always planned to forge them into somethin', but I could never get myself to melt 'em down.</CR>  I know you're tryin' your hardest Kid, but take it from me, everyone needs a helpin' hand.</LB></LB>  These stones?  I ain't ever gonna use them, and you're not doin' so great out there, sooooo...</CR>  ... Look, all I'm tryin' to say is good luck Kid, we're rootin' for you.

LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_CAN_SEE_YOUR_SOUL_1	Hello Ducky, glad to see you again.</LB> Don't be surprised that I know it's you, we can all tell.  Same you, different body. </CR>  Live long enough and you'll start seeing past the shell too.  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_MORNING_TEA_1	Ducky!  Please, come and share some Koshary Tea with me.</LB> Morning tea is one of the greatest traditions ever made, and you should never skip it.</CR>  I like mine with <size=125%>LOTS</size> of sugar and <size=125%>LOTS</size> of mint.</LB></LB> ... Like, a lot.</CR>  ... It's probably more sugar than tea.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_FATTAH_1	Ducky, care for some Lamb Fattah?</LB> It's lamb and garlic, and rice, and tomatoes, and everything delicious!</LB></LB> It's one of my favourite dishes, so don't be bashful when asking for seconds.</CR>   ... Seriously, feel free.  I made too much because I keep forgetting how small I am.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_RED_AETHER_1	Ducky, those Runes are just a taste.  If <b>you</b> want the gooood stuff, you have to give <b>me</b> the gooood stuff.</CR>  By good stuff for me, I'm talking about <color=blue>Red Aether</color>...</LB> ... It will help me live forever!</CR>  And good stuff for you, I mean stacking Runes.</CR>  ... Stacking Runes is more complicated than you think.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_NO_MIST_1	Have you ever wondered, Ducky?  The Docks are so close to the water, yet everything up here is dry.</LB></LB> ... Whatever is below isn't water, it just really looks like water.</CR>  And don't even think about taking a dip.  That water's poisonous, Ducky.</LB> It's heavy too.  I have tossed a few things in there and they all sink.</CR>    ... I wonder why the Living Safe can stay in it?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_TOTEM_DOES_NOT_EAT_1	I made the Totem some Kofta, but I guess it doesn't eat.</LB></LB> ... It's so strange because the Living Safe eats it just fine.</CR>  ... Anyways, want some leftover Kofta?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_LOOKING_GOOD_1	You hungry, Ducky?</LB></LB>  I made some Om Ali for you.  It is best hot so you should eat it now.</CR>  ... It's one of my favourite desserts, so if you don't like it, I'll take it back. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_INTERESTED_IN_BLACKSMITH_1	Ducky, that man beside me interests me.</LB> He repaired my lamp post, and I wish to thank him.</CR>   Do you know if he likes... how do you say... good food?</LB></LB>  I am thinking of inviting him over for some Ful, but I don't want to scare him away if his palate is too boorish.</CR>  Perhaps I should cook him something more familiar?</LB> Maybe I'll make that dish you commoners all seem to love.</LB></LB>  What is it called again? ... A ham-borg-er?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_DATE_WENT_WELL_1	Nice to see you, Ducky!</LB> I had dinner with the giant blacksmith yesterday and I wanted to talk to someone about it!</CR>  At first, it did not start off great.</LB> He showed up smelling of soot and wearing his blacksmith apron...</CR>  Plus, I was still cooking, so I had my apron on too!</LB> <size=75%>I can't believe we had matching outfits...</size></CR>  But the dinner went better than expected!</LB> He's quite the conversationalist!</CR>  Blacksmithing and Rune crafting have a lot in common.</LB> Yes, we do different things, but the fundamentals are similar and we share the same passion for our trade.</LB></LB>  It was refreshing being able to talk to someone about things like this.</LB> A man with drive is quite appealing!</CR>  ... Plus, he was pretty handsome in that apron.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_DUMMY_DOES_NOT_EAT_1	Hi Ducky!</LB> I had a terrible dream that the Sage Totem was lying to me about not needing to eat, because he just didn’t like my cooking...</LB> Sooooo I made some Kofta and offered it to Quinn today.</CR>   ... Well, long story short, she doesn’t eat either...</CR>   ... Anyways, want some Kofta?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_SLEEP_APNEA_1	Ducky, you sleeping well?  Your eyes look like hollow holes leading into the abyss.</LB> I used to have a terrible time sleeping too.</LB></LB>  Some days I'd be more tired waking up than before I went to bed.</CR>  Turns out I had <color=blue>Sleep Apnea</color>, and was not breathing properly during my beauty rest.</LB> I never did have a growth spurt, and I'm certain it's because the <color=blue>Apnea</color> stunted my growth!</CR>  The proof is in the puddin', pudding.</LB> So fix your sleeping habits now or be forever short like me!  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_LOVE_PILLOWS_1	Still having trouble sleeping, Ducky?</LB> Well let me reveal to you the beauty of PILLOWS!</CR>  A comfortable body leads to a comfortable mind, and a good pillow will change your life.</LB></LB>  They've changed mine, and I'm never looking back <size=75%>(to a life of bad pillows)</size>.  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_RESTLESS_LEG_EXPLAIN_1	Most people think that pillows are just for resting, but I use them for everything!</LB> I use them for sleeping, for propping, for sitting, for decor...</LB></LB>  ... I even use a flat pillow for running!</CR>  Sometimes when I sit still for too long my legs begin to feel restless.</LB> That's when I run on my pillows!</LB></LB>  It's great for when you need to exercise, but don't actually want to go anywhere... 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_APNEA_PILLOWS_1	Duckkky!  You interested in more pillow talk?</LB> Welllll, I also use a special pillow to help with my <color=blue>Apnea</color>.</LB> I've tried hundreds of pillows, and I have one that is my favourite.</CR>  It's shaped like a wedge and I use it to raise my neck and upper back.</LB> But lying in one position every night is no good, and every so often I have to switch it up.</CR>  So even though I have a hundred pillows, you can't have any of them.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_PIZZA_GIRL_CHARISMA_1	Have you ever spoken to the Pizza Lady, Ducky?</LB>  She is a <i>fascinating</i> character, and her soul glows brightly too.</LB> There's something very special about her, and I do not mean her pizza.</LB></LB>  I think she is someone you can trust.</CR>  She is very charismatic for a pizza delivery person!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_BAD_BACK_1	OoOOoooOOOooh...</LB></LB>  Hi Ducky.</CR>    Do not expect me to get up today.</LB> I tried sleeping on a metal pillow yesterday and my neck is killing me.</CR>   I hate to disappoint that giant man, but I think I will stick with my countless other pillows.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_NICKNAME_1	Do you know why I call you 'Ducky'?</LB> It is because of that glow around you.  You exude an energy that makes you look round and fuzzy, like a baby chick.</CR>  Also because you're cute and tiny!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_BABA_GANOUSH_1	Hi Ducky, I made some Baba Ganoush and pita for your boat trip.</LB> It is a delicious snack to have while you are on your long journey.</CR>  I made extra so you could give some to Charon as well.</LB> He looks like he could use a nice meal.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_RESTLESS_LEG_FLARE_UP_1	Sorry, I am not up for much chit-chat today, Ducky.</LB> My legs were restless last night, and I was going crazy.</CR>  I was jogging on my pillow all night, but it did not help.</LB> I shall try and take a nap later today.</LB></LB>  By later I mean right after you leave.  It's not like I have THAT many customers...	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_MADE_SOME_SOUP_1	Hey Ducky, my poor little giant's hands have been hurting.</LB> I made some Orzo soup to comfort him, but I made too much.</CR>  He is so big that sometimes it's hard to know how much I should make, so I have plenty left over.</LB> Take it with you on the boat.</LB></LB>  You can share it with your pizza girlfriend and your boatman boyfriend.</CR>  It's chicken, it's soup, it's pasta.  It's delicious.</LB> Trust me, you three will love it.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_WEIGHTED_BLANKET_1	Ooooooh Ducky, my darling giant is sooo nice!</LB> He took one of my blankets, and sewed some glass beads into it.</CR>  He calls it a weighted blanket and I just adore it.</LB> It has really helped me on the nights I get restless.</CR>  ... He's so thoughtful.  Like a giant ducky. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_LOVELY_DAY_1	Ooooh Ducky, it is a lovely day!</LB>  That weighted blanket has done wonders for my sleep!</CR>  It was too heavy in the beginning but Athos removed a few beads until we found the perfect weight, and now I love it.</LB>  He's such a gentle giant!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_RING_ORIGIN_1	Have you heard the news, Ducky?  I'm getting married!</LB> Athos was making a ring for me and was surprised I knew what it meant.</CR>  Isn't that silly, Ducky?</LB> He thought wedding rings were a custom from his land, but it came from us originally.</LB></LB> Imagine, taking someone else's traditions and believing them to be your own...</CR>   ...

Isn't that silly?</LB> He thought the game was a custom from his land, but...</CR>  ... Well, maybe they also made it up.</LB> Rock-paper-scissors isn't exactly hard to come up with.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ENCHANTRESS_RING_MEANING_1	Did you know that the ring is a symbol for eternal life and love?</LB> My baba told me that.  But he also said it meant the sun and the moon, so maybe he's just making it up as he goes.</CR>  I just like how they look!

LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_ONCE_A_BARD_1	Child, have you come to hear my stories?</LB> I used to be a bard y'know?  A teller of stories, both fables and truths.</CR>  And I was famous!  Known all across the lands as</LB> 'He Who Tells the Worst Stories'.</CR>  Now, I may have been bad, but I was famous!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_TALE_OF_THE_FOX_1	Child, let me tell you about the Tale of the Clever Fox.</CR>  Long ago, there was a fox.  It was a clever fox.</LB> There was also a farmer.  He was a clever farmer.</CR>  The clever fox kept sneaking into the clever farmer's barn and eating all his clever chickens.</LB></LB> See, the chickens were also clever.  Not clever enough to avoid being eaten mind you, and also not clever enough to be relevant to the story.</CR>  Anyways, one day the clever farmer had enough and decided to set up a clever trap to catch the clever fox.</LB></LB>  He placed the clever chickens in his clever house, and hid in the clever barn himself to catch the clever fox.</CR>  That night, the clever fox sloooowly entered the clever barn, where he met the clever farmer.</LB> Since there were no clever chickens to eat, the clever fox ate the clever farmer instead.</LB></LB>  The End.</CR>  The moral of the story is that just because you say something's clever, does not make it clever.</LB></LB>  ... Also, I've said the word 'clever' so many times, I've forgotten what it means.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_LOCK_CASTLE_AGAIN_1	A good story never changes.  This Kingdom does not have a good story.</LB> You should fix that, Child.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_TALE_OF_THE_TURTLE_1	Child, have you heard the story of the Turtle and the Hare?</CR>  Once upon a time there was a turtle and a hare.</LB></LB>  The turtle was called Jiminy Cricket.</LB> And the hare was called Jiminy Turtle.</CR>  Jiminy Cricket the turtle was sloooooow.  And ooooold.</LB></LB>  ... Sooo ooooold.</CR>  On the other hand, Jiminy Turtle the hare was also ooooold.  And sloooow.</LB></LB>  ... So very oooold.</CR>  One day, Cricket the turtle and Turtle the hare went outside.  They never met each other because they were both so slloooow and ooold.</LB></LB>  They also didn't live near one another.</CR>  Eventually Cricket the turtle died of ooooold age.</LB> A few years later Turtle the hare also died of oooold age.</LB></LB>  The End.</CR>   The moral of this story is that age kills all.</LB></LB> .... I don't have long in this world.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_LUCK_AND_TALENT_1	One thing I've learned in my many years of life, Child, is that there is luck and there is talent.</LB> And if you can pick only one, <i>always</i> pick luck.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_LOVES_PIZZA_1	Child, have you ever had pizza?</CR>  It is delicious!</LB> Maria gave me a slice so I had to return the favour.  I regaled her with one of my stories, and now she avooooids me!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_RED_AETHER_1	I had taken many jobs in my day, Child.</LB> I've been a waiter, a bard, an innkeeper, a bookkeeper, a beekeeper, a keykeeper and many more keepers.</CR>  I've had soooo many jobs because I'm baaaad at everything I do.</LB></LB>  I would have died old and poor, but one day I was fishing when I caught a treasure chest!</CR>  It was full of <color=blue>Red Aether</color>!  To the brim I say!</LB></LB>  I only took a few, and I haven't aged a day since!</CR>  I always believed luck should be shared, Child.  So I began travelling the world, giving away all the <color=blue>Red Aether</color> I had found.</CR>  I gave it all away long ago, but if I still had some left I'd have gladly given it to you.</LB></LB>  Fortune should be shared, and it looks like you need all the luck you can get.</CR>  ... Actually, now that I think about it, I've stumbled onto many treasure chests in my life.</LB></LB> I really am quite lucky!</CR>  I even found this drill in a ditch!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_GOOD_DAY_1	Gooooood day Child.  Don't you wish eeeeveryday was like this?</LB> Because I could do that for you!</CR>  No wait, I can't.</LB> I don't lock down the weather.</LB></LB>  ... At least not yet!</CR>  Oh wait, I forgot that the weather never changes down here.</LB></LB>  Nevermind!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_TALE_OF_THE_ELEPHANT_1	Child, let me tell you the Tale of the Clever Elephant.</CR>  Long ago, there was an elephant.  It was a clever elephant.</LB> There was also a circus trainer.  He was a clever circus trainer.</CR>  The clever elephant kept sneaking into the clever circus trainer's tent and eating all his clever peanuts.</LB></LB>  These were very clever peanuts.</CR>  One day, the clever circus trainer had enough.</LB> He placed the clever peanuts in his clever house, and hid in the clever tent himself to catch the clever elephant.</CR>  That night, the clever elephant entered the clever tent and was caught by the clever circus trainer.</LB> So the clever elephant ate the clever circus trainer instead.</LB></LB>  The End.</CR>  The moral of the story is that sometimes all you need to do is change the setting and you have a brand new storrry.</CR>  ... One day I shall tell you another tale, Child.  The Tale of the Clever Monkey.</LB></LB>  ... The new setting is quite exciting!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_LIVING_SAFE_1	Have you spoken to the Living Safe, Chillld?</LB> He's been helping me with my gold.</CR>  I'm terrible with money and he helps me from becoming poooooor.</LB> What a nice safe.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_TALE_OF_THE_MOUSE_1	Child, have I ever told you the Story of the Tiny Mouse?</CR>  Once upon a time there was a tiny mouse.  One day he came upon a lion who was trapped in a net.</LB> The lion asked the mouse to help free him, but the mouse was afraid the lion would eat him.</CR>  The lion promised not to eat the mouse, so the mouse began gnawing at the net.</LB> When the lion was almost free he lunged at the mouse and ate the poor thing.</CR>  But the mouse never finished gnawing the rope so the lion was still trapped in the net.</LB> The lion remained stuck in the net for many days until one day, another larger mouse came up to him.</CR>  The lion asked the larger mouse to help gnaw the ropes so he could get out, but instead the mouse ate the lion.</CR>  The moral of this story is eat or be eaten.</LB>  That, and nobody likes a jerk.</CR>  Everyone feels bad for the first mouse that gets eaten, but rejoice when the lion gets his just desserts.</CR>  ... One day, you'll be eaten.</LB></LB>  Make sure people aren't cheering when that happens.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_NOT_MANY_STORIES_LEFT_1	Not many stories left, Child.</LB> Tooooold you I was a bad storyteller.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_TALE_OF_THE_MONKEY_1	Child, let me tell you the Tale of the Clever Monkey.</CR>  Long ago, there was a monkey.  It was a clever monkey.</LB> There was also a circus trainer.  He was a clever circus trainer.</CR>  The clever monkey kept sneaking into the clever circus trainer's tent and eating all his clever bananas.</LB></LB>  These were very clever peanuts.  Er, I mean bananas.</CR>  One day, the clever circus trainer had enough.</LB> He placed the clever bananas in his clever house, and hid in the clever tent himself to catch the clever monkey.</CR>  That night, the clever monkey entered the clever tent and then the clever circus trainer ate the monkey.</LB></LB>  The End.</CR>  The moral of the story is that if you keep doing the same trick, eventually you'll get caught.</CR>  ... Also, I forgot how the story ended.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_POINT_OF_STORIES_1	When I was a bard, nobody liked my stories.</LB> My tales were always sliiightly different from the stories told before.</CR>  My audience felt like they were being cheated.</LB> I tried to give them something new, but they wanted to hear stories of yore.</CR>  There's a warmth to repetition, Child.  A comfort in the familiar.</LB> But venturing into the unknown is what brings progress!</CR>  There's beauty in personality, Chiillld.</LB></LB>  When you find your own personality, you'll understand how important it is.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_IS_THIS_AN_ANCHOR_1	Child, I just noticed my drill has a screen in it...</LB> I don't think this contraption came from this wooooorld.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_BLACKSMITH_FIXED_GLASSES_1	Athos fixed my glasses, Child.</LB>  I did not know he was a glassblower as well.</LB> Like me, he has gathered many different skills over the years.</CR>  ... Unlike me, he is good at those skills. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_FATHER_TELLS_STORIES_1	When I was a child, my father told me stories too.</LB> He was too laaaazy to buy the books, so he recited them from memory.</CR>  The details changed, the plots changed, and sometimes even the morals changed.</CR>  And that is what makes the <color=blue>Oral Tradition</color> so beautiful, Child.</LB> The stories change as we do.</CR>  Stories on paper are set in stone.  They are a time capsule, only showing people for who they were back then and not who they are now.</CR>  ... And that's the moral of this story.</LB></LB>  The only 'you' that matters is the 'you' right now.</CR>  The Ennnnnnnd.</CR>  ...... </CR>  ... Why aren't you leaving? 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_NO_MORE_STORIES_FOR_NOW_1	No more stories from me, Child. </LB> The well has run dry... for now.</CR>  In other words, maybe more stories later.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_LONG_DAY_1	Gooood day Child.</LB></LB>  The days are long, the nights are non-existent, and we shall live forever!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_ARCHITECT_REWARD_1	Child, along my journey I've collected many unique rocks and minerals.</LB></LB>  These rocks here? They're called <color=blue>Soul Stones</color> and they're what adventures are made of!</CR>  I've had my adventures, but you can still have yours.</LB> Please take them and share with me the stories you find.</LB></LB>  That way, I can take them and make them my owwwwwwwwwwwwwn.

LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_TANNING_1	Mmmmm... I like it up here.</LB> Y'know, if it wasn't for all the m-m-monsters, and the danger, and the m-m-monsters, these Docks would be pretty nice.</CR>   ... Plus, I'm getting a nice wood tan.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_TENDRILS_1	A star floated close by me the other day.</LB> It was translucent and had these long t-t-tendrils, and it was beautiful.</LB></LB>  Or, at least I think it was beautiful...</CR>  ... Come to think of it, I don't think that was a star.</CR>  ... Either way, I didn't get a good look.  It was scary so I c-climbed down and hid.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_PIZZA_1	Maaaan... What's a girl gotta do to get some p-p-pizza?</CR>  ... I don't eat food, but I like how it looks.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SPELLSWORD_FIGHTING_MASTER_1	Did you know that <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color> p-p-pioneered most of the fighting styles that we use today?</CR>  He mastered the s-sword, the axe, the spear, and so m-m-many more cool things.</LB> He's my hero!  I bet he's a great guy!</CR>   ... I mean, I've never met him, but someone who knows that much about combat can't be bad!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_HI_STUTTER_1	H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-hi.</CR>  S-s-sorry, extra stuttery t-t-today.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SUNDAYS_1	My favourite days are Sundays.</LB></LB>  They're just like every other day, but I like how it s-s-s-sounds...</CR>  ... S-s-s-sundays.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_LIVING_TOTEM_DATE_1	The S-s-sage Totem asked if I was doing anything today.</LB></LB>  I-I-I-I said I'm noooooooooooooooot.</CR>  ... He said ok and then left.</CR>  I don't know what that was.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_WONDER_WHY_WEAPONS_1	I sometimes wonder why I like weapons so much.</LB> I don't like the f-f-fighting...</LB></LB>  <size=75%>(And I d-d-don't like people hurting each other.)</size></CR>  I think I just l-like the elegance of it all.</LB> The simplicity of a tool meant for a single purpose.</LB></LB>  The devotion of the people who learn to wield it.</CR>  ... And the A-A-A-AWESOME COMBOS.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SPELLSWORD_FIRST_1	<color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color> w-was the f-f-first Spellsword y'know that?</LB></LB> Before him, knights just swung swords and mages just swang spells.</CR>  After he took over, he made e-e-veryone be interdisciplinary.</LB> He thought it was important that everyone understood a bit of e-everything.  Now? The knights can swing swords AND cast spells.</LB> And the m-mages?</CR>  ... Well, they still just cast spells.</LB> Mages have really weak arms.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_DONT_SWEAT_THE_DETAILS_1	S-s-some people are such sticklers over t-t-terminology.</LB> Falchion, swords, estocs, sabers.</LB></LB>  Sure they're 'different', but not enough to make a f-f-fuss I say.</CR>  L-l-let more people love weapons!  Bother them with the details later!</LB></LB>  Don't push down the people who are just getting into the hobby.</LB> Details are for the hardcore fans!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_PIZZA_GIRL_WEAPONS_1	I-I've been talking to Maria a lot recently.</LB> She's r-r-really nice.</LB></LB>  I'm glad you found her!</CR>  Also, she tries to hide it, but she knows a lot about weapons!</LB></LB> ... S-s-she's cool.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SECOND_DATE_WITH_TOTEM_1	Heya.</LB> M-M-Maria asked m-me how my date with the Sage Totem went.</LB></LB>  ... I didn't know we even went on a d-d-date!</CR>  He's very n-n-nice, but he's somehow more awkward than I am...</LB></LB>  <size=75%>(... Never thought I'd say that...)</size></CR>  ... Perhaps I'll ask him out again properly (A s-second first date?)</LB> <size=75%>(I've never asked someone out before... This is scary.)</size>	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SECOND_SUCCESS_1	The second date was quite a s-success!</LB> The Enchantress was l-l-lovely and made us a meal.</LB></LB>  Neither of us eat, but the food looked d-d-delicious.</LB> <size=75%>(I gave the leftovers to Maria.)</size></CR>  Sage Totem is very smart.  W-w-we spoke about far off lands and their cultures.</LB></LB>  He's so knowledgeable, and he makes everything sound so exciting!</CR>  Plus, he told me all about the different weapons and f-f-fighing styles in other cultures!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_HEAD_IN_CLOUDS_1	... Sorry, you caught me off guard.</LB> M-m-my head's been in the clouds recently.</CR>  ... I've been hanging out with S-sage Totem and my days have all been a tizzy.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_NICKNAME_FOR_TOTEM_1	I called Sage Totem 'Totes' the other day and he asked what that was.</LB> He's never had a nickname before so he was pretty confused.</CR>  After I told him w-what it was, he ended up really liking it!</LB></LB>  ... Although maybe he liked it a little too much.</CR>  ... He started repeating it non-stop.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_ARCHITECT_TALKING_TALES_1	The A-a-architect comes up here sometimes and tells me stories.</LB></LB>  His stories are weird and looong.</CR>  ... Also, there's no fighting in them!  Everyone’s too clever!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_WORKING_ON_STUTTER_1	Hello Friend!  Notice something different?</LB></LB>  I'll give you time to guess!</CR>  ............</CR>  Oh wait, you can't tell if I don't talk.</LB></LB>  My stutter's gone!</CR>  Well, not really.  I've just been working to s-s-stutter less.  Oops!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_THINK_AND_ENUNCIATE_1	Thinking longer and putting more effort into speaking helps my stutter.</CR>  I have to be especially careful with sounds that jumble me up, like</LB> L, T, F, S, D...  You g-g-get the picture.</LB> <size=75%>(Oops, and G.)</size></CR>  Totes has been secretly teaching me through all this!</LB>  It's great, because apparently he's a trained linguist AND a <color=blue>polyglot</color>.</CR>  ... What's a polyglot?</LB></LB>  I f-f-forgot.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_MINDFUL_SPEAKING_1	Ever notice how you can talk before the words have had time to form in your head?</LB></LB>  We're so quick with our tongue because of how natural speech is to us.</CR>  To work on my stutter, I practice <color=blue>mindful speaking</color>.</LB> I try to have the next sentence ready in my head before I start talking.</LB></LB>  I'm a little slower, but now I find the things I say are more purposeful.</CR>  Even if you don't have a stutter, I highly recommend trying it out.</LB> It's quite enjoyable and it's led to better conversations.</CR>  The only time I struggle to <color=blue>mindfully speak</color> is when I'm too emotional, or when I talk about w-weapons...</CR>  ... Uh-oh, j-j-just thinking about w-weapons is getting me e-e-excited!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_IRAD_BRAINS_1	Know who my two favourite <color=blue>Estuaries</color> are?</LB></LB> If I had to choose, it'd be <color=blue>Lamech and Irad</color>.</CR>  <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color> is s-s-strong and forceful.  He trained all of the soldiers and mastered many combat techniques.</CR>  <color=blue>Estuary Irad</color>, on the other hand, is a brilliant strategist.</LB></LB> He was the King's second-in-command and the General to all of the royal armies.</CR>  ... I wish they made action figures of them.   	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SEE_THE_WORLD_1	I've been talking with Totes a lot, and he's convinced me to travel the world with him after we leave here.</CR>  I like it here on the Docks, y'know?</LB> Just relaxing and letting the world come to me.</LB></LB>  But he showed me how much I've been missing.</CR>  L-l-life out there sounds e-e-exciting, and I don't wanna miss it!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_HELLO_1	Bonjourno Friend!  It's a lovely day!</CR>  Totem's been teaching me how to say hello in different languages.</LB> This one was the italicized version of hello.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_THE_GREAT_GENERAL_1	Did you know <color=blue>Estuary Irad</color> was known as the 'Great General'?</LB> H-h-he's in all the books!</CR>  But that also makes me feel bad.  Everyone praises the strategies, but what about the soldiers?</LB> The soldiers trained by <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color> are the only reason <color=blue>Irad's</color> strategies worked in the first place!</CR>  ... I think the fame shoulda been split f-f-fifty-f-fifty.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_LIVING_SAFE_MONEY_1	Atticus the Living Safe said I should invest my money with him.</LB></LB>  ... I don't have any money.</CR>  Can I have some money?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_READING_EVERY_NIGHT_1	I read a book out loud every night to help with my stutter.</LB> If I stutter over a sentence, I read that sentence again, but a little slower.</CR>  The more I read, the faster I get.</LB> Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping backwards which is annoying, but at least I still get to read.</CR>  ... Totes is usually by my side while I read, which is really nice too.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_SPENT_THE_NIGHT_1	Totes spent the n-night up here with me again.</LB> It was really nice...</CR>  Thanks again for helping us m-meet, Friend.</LB> The days are much more interesting when he's around.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_LOOKING_GOOD_1	Hi Friend!  You're looking good today!</LB></LB>  Here for some practice?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_DUMMY_REWARD_1	Hi again Friend!  I was rooting through my stuff yesterday looking for a cook book for Nunet, when I stumbled upon these amazing <color=blue>Soul Stones</color>.</CR>  ... I thought I gave them all to her <size=75%>(as a gift)</size>, but I guess I missed a bunch behind the couch...</LB></LB>  Ummm... Would you like the rest?

LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_BUILD_SKILL_TREE_1	PSSST!</LB>  Hey Friend-o, can I give you some advice?</CR>  Don't worry too much about how much you've got in savings right now.  We're in a bull market.  You need to spend money to make money. </CR>  Upgrade that manor o' yours.  INVEST IN YOU BEFORE YOU INVEST IN ME.</LB> Sounds crazy, right?  But I'm telling you buoy, this is how you make money!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_CHANGE_HIS_LOOK_1	Hey Friend-o, I was thinking of changing buoys.  This one's feelin' a little old-fashioned.</LB> Kinda clashes with my decor, don't you think?</LB></LB>  Doesn't scream classy.</CR>  I'm thinking something with stars or gold coins emblazoned on it.</LB></LB> Maybe some diamonds, or crowns...</CR>  Y'know what?</LB></LB> The more I talk about it, the more I like this buoy. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_USED_TO_BE_A_DAD_1	I wasn't always all about investments, Friend-o.</LB> I used to be a dad, and an okay one at that.</CR>  I remember how wrinkly my kid was when he was born.</LB> I always thought babies were cute and smooth, and malleable.</CR>  ... My kid looked like a raisin that was dried out in the sun.  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_HELPING_DUMMY_INVESTMENT_1	Y'know that Lady Quinn?  She helps you out, gives tips and tricks, and she never gets paid.</LB>  She may not need money now, but she'll need it someday.</CR>  ... She won't ask though, so I've been squirrelin' some away for her from the side investments I make from you.</LB></LB>  So make more money yeah?  You're helpin' out a lot more people than you know.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_USED_TO_TELL_STORIES_1	Used to tell my kid stories when he was growin' up.</LB> Problem is my dad never read any to me, so I had to make 'em up on the spot.</CR>  I jumped between made-up stories and ones I heard from others.</LB></LB>  I ain't no writer so the stories I created were terrible, but I think my son always preferred them over those proper ones.</CR>  Maybe it's because he knew they came from me...</LB></LB>  Or maybe he just had bad taste in stories, I dunno.  I enjoyed makin' 'em up though.  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_LEAVING_FOR_MONEY_1	I wanted to make more money for the family, so I left to work at a bank.</LB> The banking life?  It got to me Friend-o, it got me goood.</LB></LB>  Loved marking those ledgers in black and seeing numbers go up-up-up!</CR>  I got addicted.  I spent years there.</LB> Lost focus of my family.</CR>  But money is just a means to an end, Friend-o.  It blinded me.</LB>  Just look at me!  I turned myself into a safe because I loved money so much!</CR>  I mean...</LB> I still enjoy bein' a safe, but even I would say this was a little overboard.</CR>  Nyarf!  That was a buoy joke.</CR>  But seriously, I really do like bein' a safe! 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_WONT_SHOW_FACE_1	I don't know how long I stayed at the bank, but when I finally returned home my wife had gotten old and my child had become a man.</LB></LB>  I couldn't face them, y'know?  Too much shame.</CR>  But I knew I needed to make it up to them.  I went back to the city, and quit my job.  I even joined a support group.</LB> The allure was too much for me, Friend-o.  I knew I needed help.</CR>   ... Lemme tell you, joining a group where your problem is that you make too much money isn't a good look!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_WHY_CALLED_ARCHITECT_1	They don't call that old man an Architect because of his bad story tellin', you know?</LB></LB>  ... Or because of that weird drill of his.</CR>  He actually invented the <color=blue>Prefabricated Room</color>.</LB> It's the standardization of a room shape, all the way down to wall heights, door placements, and even plumbing!</LB></LB>  Heck, that manor you're building?  It's almost entirely composed of variants of his Prefabricated Rooms.</CR>   He originally designed it to help build housing quickly for the poor.</LB> If you always knew the size and shapes of your rooms, you could get the necessary building materials made in bulk, and train everyone on how to build their own attachments in a breeze.</CR>  He knew that the more people who used the Prefabricated Room design the more powerful it becomes, so he proposed his ideas to the King.</CR>  Well, the King saw the benefits of these Prefabricated Rooms, and immediately made it the standard for future buildings.</LB></LB>  Turns out it was the right choice, seeing how the <color=blue>Shift</color> emerged.</LB> So If you ever wondered why so many rooms have similar shapes and sizes, you have the Architect to thank.</CR>  He coulda kept all those ideas to himself and built his own housing market empire, but he gave it all away for free.</LB>  ... That level of philanthropy just boggles my mind.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_WIFE_PASSED_1	I took too long to sell all of my assets back in the capitol.</LB> By the time I had returned, my wife had passed away, and my son had left the village.</CR>  I managed to find him, living the traveler's life.  Jumping from town to town, and doing the odd job here and there.</LB> I kept track of him from afar, to see how he was doin', y'know?</LB></LB>  Wanted to see him become successful like his old man!</CR>  Well, he didn't.  He flopped at almost every job he had.</LB> I secretly gave him money - hid some extra cash in his belongings every now and then.</LB></LB>  But the weirdest thing, he kept giving it away.  Drove me crazy!</CR>  In the financial world we'd call that... a depreciating market cap?</LB></LB>  Oh buoy, I'm forgettin' all the lingo!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_BUYING_RED_AETHER_1	I couldn't leave my son alone, y'know?  He was gettin' old.</LB> So I spent the rest of the money I had to buy enough <color=blue>Red Aether</color> for my son to live a hundred more lifetimes.</CR>  I stashed it in a place I knew he’d find.</LB> He shares my blood, he has greatness in him.</LB></LB>  ... He just needed a bit more time to make it on his own. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_LOOKING_WEALTHY_1	Hey Friend-o, you feelin' wealthy?  'Cause you're lookin' wealthy!</CR>  ... Are you wealthy?  I can't really tell.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_GIVES_AWAY_ALL_THE_RED_AETHER_1	When I gave all the <color=blue>Red Aether</color> to my son, I promised myself that this was gonna be my last handout.</CR>  And if there's one thing I stick to, it's my promises.</LB> That's why my clients can always trust me with their gold, Friend-o.</CR>  ... Well, he handed all that <color=blue>Red Aether</color> away too.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_ONLY_GOOD_JOB_1	Y'know Friend-o, I always thought my son was talentless.</LB> Kind of a disappointment, y'know?  Couldn't make money and couldn't hold a job.</CR>  I just wanted him to be successful in life and become rich like his old man.  But I was just coverin' up for my own mistakes.</LB> I shoulda never left my family.</CR>  Money's a drug, Friend-o, you can never have enough.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_CHANGE_IN_PERSPECTIVE_1	Y’know, my son eventually found something he was good at.</LB> Turns out he had a knack for architecture.</LB></LB>  It’s ironic.  The things he did well he never charged money for.</CR>  I love my son, Friend-o.  He's kind and generous, and being close to him made me a better person.</LB>  I've taken some life lessons from him, and switched over to helping the poor and financially ignorant (like yourself).</CR>  It finally feels like I'm doin' something with my life.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_LAZING_IN_THE_SUN_1	... Mmmrguh?</CR>  Sorry Friend-o, musta fallen asleep in the sun.  How can I help you?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_GREET_HIS_SON_1	When we get out of here, I'm gonna tell my son who I am.</LB></LB>  I was stupid to not say anything back then, and I'm more stupid for not sayin' anything now.</CR>  ... Thanks for listening to me this whole time, Friend-o.</LB> Havin' an ear to speak to really helped.  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_FRIEND_1	Friend-o, how can I help you today?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_LIVING_SAFE_REWARD_1	Hey Friend-o, did you know my business has been booming because of you?  It's true!</CR>  It was tough gettin' new clients down here.</LB> I guess speaking to the living embodiment of one's financial failures makes people nervous.</LB></LB>  Even if it's hanging out innocuously in a life preserver!</CR>   But these chit-chats you 'n me have?  Friend-o, that's an ice breaker!</LB></LB>  People see you talkin', people see me talkin', and eventually everyone's talkin'.</CR>  Anyways, didn't feel right to not give you a cut of my success, so here you go.  I'm giving you some <color=blue>Soul Stones</color> that I've collected over the years.</CR>  Just be wise with how you spend them, Friend-o...</LB> ... In the eyes of the right buyer, it's more valuable than gold...</CR>   ............</LB></LB>  ... The right buyer are those kids in the Drift House, by the way.</LB> I don't know why I was being so vague about it.

LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_ENJOY_COMPANY_1	Heya Stranger!  Thanks again for letting me ride the boat with you.</LB> I enjoy the company and I'm pretty sure you enjoy the free pizza!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_FEEL_SOIL_1	Somedays I really miss the smell and feel of the forest.</LB> The Docks are beautiful but there's nothing quite like waking up to the smell of dew.</CR>  <color=blue>Estuary Naamah</color> could be remarkably cruel, but she was really good at her job.</LB> She tended to the forest and it grew under her care.</CR>  It sounds lame, right?  But down here, doing something like that takes more than just hard work.</LB></LB>  ... I don't think anyone else could have done what she did.</CR>  ..............</CR>  ... Know what else I miss?  Pizza.</LB></LB>  And I just had some like, 20 minutes ago!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_GARDENERS_1	Did you know I used to be a farmer?  Just like everyone else in the Kingdom.</LB> Technically our titles were "Gardeners", but we never called ourselves that.</CR>  We tended the lands and grew crops in a natural setting.</LB> No tilling, no pens, no fields.</LB></LB>  That was <color=blue>Estuary Naamah's</color> rules.  Leave the land in a better spot than when we arrived.</CR>  I try to take that rule to heart when interacting with people too.</LB> If we all worked to help each other, the world would be a much better place.</CR>  Maybe that's why I like delivering pizza so much.</LB></LB>  Everyone likes pizza!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_GOOD_FEELING_1	I've got a good feeling about today, Stranger.</LB> You're looking like you’re full of vigour, I'm looking like I’m full of pizza, and the weather's... lookin' like it always does.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_TAKING_SHIFTING_FOR_GRANTED_1	I still remember when I decided to quit being a farmer.</LB> I specialized in foraging, and I was one of the fastest in the whole Kingdom.</CR>  I always seemed to know when a <color=blue>Shift</color> would happen, and where it'd take you.</LB> So I'd always forage in places where I knew the <color=blue>Shift</color> would bring me close to Axis Mundi.</LB></LB>  Cutting your travel time in half makes fulfilling quotas prettttty easy.</CR>  I always took this intuition for granted.</LB> There were always other foragers around me, so I assumed everyone else had this ability as well.</LB></LB>  Well, it turns out they don't.  They were all just following me.</CR>  Rumors spread that if anyone spoke to me about it, then I would lose my ability.  So I was left in the dark for years.</LB></LB>  ... I only found out when someone got hurt.  He broke the taboo, and asked if I could <color=blue>Shift</color> them to the Citadel...</CR>  ... Silly, isn't it?  All these misconceptions kept building on top of one another.</LB></LB>  If someone just spoke up, I wouldn't have taken my gift for granted, and I could have helped so many more people.</CR>   That's when I stopped being a farmer.</LB></LB>  I took my savings, and went to apply at the Stygian Study.</LB> If I could understand how my intuition worked, then maybe I could teach others too.</CR>  ... Know what's ironic?  The moment I discovered that I had this ability, I left the village.</LB> In the end, nobody could use my talents anymore, so I guess the rumor ended up being true after all!</CR>  ... Don't let that ruin the moral of the story though. 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_THANKS_FOR_LISTENING_1	Thanks for listening to my story back then, Stranger.</LB></LB>  You know, if you're down here long enough, you stop really seeing faces and start recognizing people's souls.</LB> Everyone down here can do it.  Probably an effect of being by the <color=blue>Stygian</color> for so long.</CR>  Your soul is special.  It glows like a thousand small lights.</LB> ALMOST like an <color=blue>Estuary's</color>... but different.</CR>  It has a 'nicer' glow to it...</LB></LB>  You're like a tree covered in fireflies, but y'know... Not made of bugs.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_LONELY_RETURN_1	Hey again, Stranger.  You going out to the Kingdom soon?</LB> Try to take better care of yourself, yeah?</LB></LB>  The trips back on my own can get pretty lonely.</CR>  ... And honestly, the morbidity of it all is kinda disturbing.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_PREGNANCY_SEA_SICK_1	Hey Stranger... Sorry for throwing up on you the last time we went out to sea.</LB> Somedays even just looking at the sea gets me sick.</CR>  I've sailed on boats all my life so I don't know why it happens, but it sucks.</LB> If I'm feeling sick again,  I'll uhhh... try to turn my head faster.</LB> <size=75%>(sorry again.)</size>	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_GATHERING_REGRETFUL_PEASANTS_1	Never expected to be down here this long, did you?</LB> Don't rush yourself.  I'm still finding refugees every day and ferrying them across these <color=blue>Stygian Waters</color>.</CR>  Many people have waited their entire life to be rescued, but I can see it in their eyes.</LB> They're gonna miss this place...</LB></LB>  ... Even at its worst, there's still a lot to love down here.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_GETTING_PIZZA_JOB_1	Heya Stranger!</LB></LB>  Did you know I only snagged my pizza delivery job after deciding to become a geologist at the <color=blue>Stygian Study</color>?</CR>   It was supposed to be short-term, but it ended up being my dream job.</LB> The pay was bad, but everything else about it was perfect!</LB></LB>  I could schedule my own hours and the location was smack dab in the centre of <color=blue>Axis Mundi</color>.</CR>  I delivered pizza by day, and at night I went to the <color=blue>Citadel</color> to study geology.</LB> I apprenticed under some of the best minds in the Kingdom.</LB></LB>  I guess I had a zeal for geology because it was always easy to find a tutor willing to offer a helping hand.</CR>  ... That or it was because I gave out free pizzas! 	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_PREGNANCY_FOOD_GENEROSITY_1	I really like the folks you've got around here, Stranger.  They're good people.</LB> I don't have a penny to my name (Charon takes all of that), but they've all been taking care of me down here.</CR>  Your Enchantress friend is extra nice too.</LB> She may seem haughty at first, but she's been cooking for me almost every day.</CR>  A person can only eat so much pizza, y'know?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_PIZZA_FOOD_STONE_1	Did you know that pizza is one of the cheapest foods to make in the world?</LB> All it takes is dough, tomatoes, and cheese.</LB></LB>  It's so simple and everyone loves it!</CR>  When we first came down here <color=blue>Estuary Naamah</color> heavily rationed everything, but tomatoes and wheat are easy to grow.</LB> We've always had ample amounts of those ingredients, so pizza just naturally became a staple.</CR>  Before my time cheese was still a rarity, so most people just ate tomato pizzas.</LB> I've never tried it, but apparently it's delicious!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_OPENING_AN_ACCOUNT_1	Heya Stranger, do you think I could open an account with the Living Safe too?</LB></LB>  Sometimes I find a coin here and there.  Seems like a waste to just give it to Charon.</CR>  Although, maybe I should just keep giving him whatever I find... It does kinda feel like I'm taking advantage of his generosity.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_GIVE_ME_HOPE_1	You're a good person, Stranger.</LB> We've met so many times, and each time that glow within you gets stronger.</LB> I'm starting to get an inkling what that glow's all about.  It gives me hope.</CR>  ... It's nice to look at hope sometimes.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_ASK_TOTEM_QUIET_1	Hey Stranger, do you think you could ask the Sage Totem to stop shouting all the time?</LB>  I like him and all, but he needs to control his levels!  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_PIZZA_LIFE_DIRECTION_1	Studying geology became a passion of mine, but delivering pizza was always my true love.</LB> You know who orders pizza?  Everyone. </CR>  From the weak and homeless, to the most powerful of <color=blue>Estuaries</color>, everyone gets a hankerin' for pizza.</CR>  <color=blue>Lamech</color> liked meat pizzas with mushrooms, and <color=blue>Enoch</color> liked pineapples on his.</LB> <color=blue>Naamah</color> was always vegetarian, and <color=blue>Irad's</color> was a simple cheese and pepperoni.</LB> <color=blue>Tubal</color> didn't have a favourite.  He switched it up a lot.</CR>  Point is, we're all the same.  We all just wanna be happy.</LB> I feel like if everyone respected that, so many problems in life would just go away.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_BLACKSMITH_BELT_1	The Blacksmith made me a new belt the other day.</LB> He saw how frayed my last one was, and he just gave it to me as a present.</CR>  I like it a lot!  It's very shiny.	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_NICE_DAY_FOR_PIZZA_1	Heya Buddy, sorry if I'm a little slow.  I'm feeling pooped today.</LB></LB>  I don't know why, but my energy levels have been all sorts of whack recently.</CR>  Maybe I'm not eating enough pizza...	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_PIZZA_SHIFTING_1	Do you know how hard it is to deliver pizza in a place that keeps <color=blue>Shifting</color>?</LB> On the really rough days I used to wonder if it was all worth it.</CR>  But after every delivery I made, I learned something new about myself.</LB> I kept getting better and better at tracking customers down, like I was strengthening my sixth sense.</CR>   That's when I stopped complaining about the <color=blue>Shifts</color>, and started looking forward to them. If there was more to them than just the underlying randomness, then maybe I could predict what would happen next.</CR>  After months of deliveries, I began to notice something.  I was always looking for a pattern, when I should have been looking for <i>rules</i>.</LB></LB>  You see, there's no pattern to pizza toppings.  I add them willy-nilly, but I don't throw all the pepperoni onto one slice.  Likewise, the castle never had all the toilets end up in one wing.</CR>  That's what led me to discover the <color=blue>Currents</color>.</LB></LB>  <color=blue>Currents</color> are the underlying slipstreams that connect those massive teleporters you use to jump from location to location.</CR>  I learned how to keep them synced, even after a <color=blue>Shift</color> happened.</LB> If I had more time, I wonder if I could figure out the <color=blue>Shift</color> entirely?  	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_STUPID_STORIES_1	Heya Buddy, you ever sit back and try to narrate your life back to yourself?</LB></LB>  I like to do that sometimes, see what my life would look like in broad strokes if someone wrote a book about me.</CR>  Every time I do it, all I can think of is how stupid a story it'd be.</LB> If I read it, I'd be all like 'Did she pay someone to write this?  It's so stupid'.</CR>  ... It'd probably be a perfect tale for the Architect...	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_NAME_HISTORY_1	Maria's not a bad name, right?</LB> For the longest time I couldn't stand it.</CR>  There's a tradition in my family where the eldest son and the eldest daughter are given names similar to their parents.</LB></LB>  My grandmother was Mariannah, who named my mother Miriam, who named me Maria.</CR>  I had so many arguments with my parents about this.</LB> I hated traditions of any kind.</CR>  Traditions can be dangerous.</LB> They're a guise that allows archaic rules to flourish.</LB></LB>  ... I was pretty contrarian.</CR>  I love my parents so I'd never change my name.</LB> But I promised myself I'd break this tradition when I had my own child.</LB></LB>  But now?  I dunno.</LB>  After spending so much time on these Docks, I see how beautiful traditions can be.</CR>  Perhaps this was something I was being too overzealous about...</CR>   ... Plus, thinking up names is tough!	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_GLAD_TO_BE_STUCK_1	Hiya Buddy, I was just thinking about my time on that bridge again.</LB> When I was stuck in that pizza place for days on end, I really thought it was the worst time of my life.</CR>  But now I'm glad it happened.  If I hadn't gotten stuck there, then who knows if we would have met?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_RIDE_AGAIN_1	We riding again, Buddy?	
LOC_ID_HUB_TOWN_DIALOGUE_PIZZA_GIRL_REWARD_1	Hey Buddy, I just wanna say thanks for helpin' me out all this time.</LB></LB>  On our last trip, one of the farmers we helped bring back actually gave me some of these <color=blue>Soul Stones</color> as a thank you.</CR>  I tried giving them back, but she wouldn't take no for an answer.</LB> I can't do much with them, but I think you could!</LB></LB>  So, from her to me to you, thanks for everything, Buddy!</CR>  I was actually gonna give them to Nunet as a wedding gift, but Quinn beat me to it...</LB></LB>  ... Hope she's ok with her wedding gift being a surprise pizza.

I know we're not out yet, but standing on these Docks, right here right now, is probably the happiest I've ever been.</CR>  ... I'd love to chill here some more but I can't.

LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_EXPLAINING_EVERYTHING_1	… Welcome to the <color=blue>Garden of Eden</color>, Traveler. </LB></LB>  Our little slice of purgatory.</CR>  I’ve been following you closely on your journey.  You are not the only one who can read memories with the power of <color=blue>Aesop’s Tome</color>.  And I’ve been reading yours…</LB></LB>  After every hard-won battle against an Estuary, you left behind a fragment of your past.  But every memory dropped was of a different life…</CR>  I now realize you are the bearer of <color=blue>Hestia’s Reliquary</color>, the fabled <color=blue>Heirloom</color> that transcends life and death itself.  Those bound to it inherit the soul and wisdom of every previous vessel.</LB></LB>  And in your memories I saw the very first soul to ever be bound to it…</LB> That of the King’s twin brother, <color=blue>Abel</color>.</CR>   Now I know why the King sent you to retrieve the Fruit.</LB> You are the last of his legacy, and the only one he trusts. </CR>  The Fruit is yours for the taking if you can defeat me, but know that I have already suffused it with the Black Root poison.</CR>  The poison won’t kill the King, but it will weaken him greatly.  The King must be stopped.  Even now we can hear the war drums above, and it is clear his invasion will not end until he has claimed the entire world.</LB></LB>  His very existence is perverse and unnatural.  He retains his vitality by stealing the souls of the people and has interrupted the growth of the Tree of Life itself, all to feed his avarice. </CR>  He is not like you, <color=blue>Abel</color>.  You save the lives of others, while he profits from their deaths.</LB></LB>  So I ask you, <color=blue>Abel</color>, what will you do?</LB> Will you give the poisoned Fruit to your King, or warn him of the truth?</CR>   Keep the answer to yourself.  Words carry lies.</LB> I will extract your memories in combat and determine the truth.</LB></LB>  For King or Country, let this battle show me who you truly are!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_KNOWLEDGE_OF_THE_LOOP_1	… We’ve been here before haven’t we, Traveler? </LB> This encounter, this conversation…</LB></LB>  It’s all so familiar...</CR>  … The longer I am by this tree, the more the fog lifts, and I can remember my past self.</LB></LB>  Our story is being retold, over and over, but it seems this tree remains constant, everywhere, at all times.</CR>   And even though some force is changing the <color=blue>Tapestry</color> of this world, we are still fated to repeat our past mistakes.</LB></LB>  All of us, it seems, except you.</LB> Perhaps it is your connection with <color=blue>Hestia’s Reliquary</color> that separates you from the <color=blue>Threads</color> that bind the rest of us.</CR>   It is only now, at the very end, am I bestowed the clarity that you’ve had all along.</LB></LB>  And because of that, I understand you are the only one that can make a difference.  Only you can make our future brighter.</CR>  If we’ve battled before, we will battle again.</LB></LB>  Come, show me how this story ends!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_HESTIA_IN_DETAIL_1	Hello again, Traveler.</LB> It is good to see you.</LB></LB>  Is it fitting to call you ‘Traveler’, I wonder?</CR>  <color=blue>Abel</color> may be the name given to you long ago, but that is not who you are anymore.</LB></LB>  And although you are immortal, you are not like your brother, the King.</CR>  The King devours the souls of those who have passed as a means to extend his life-force.  He learns nothing, and gives nothing in return.</LB></LB>  You, on the other hand, have willingly bound yourself to <color=blue>Hestia’s Reliquary</color> and offered to share your knowledge and wisdom with all those who come after.</CR>  You may have lost your own identity, but you are truly the voice of the people.  If there is anyone to place my faith in, it would be you.</LB></LB> But I cannot risk our future on faith alone.</CR>  Though you may have changed, Traveler, my duty has not.</LB></LB>  Let us play our roles and see what fate has in store!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_MISTAKES_HE_MADE_1	We meet again, Traveler.</LB></LB>  I have a confession.  Before I became a Rebel soldier I was a General of the Citadel’s army, and known as the ‘Master of Swords’.</CR>  Even after secretly switching sides, I could not halt my duties to the Estuaries as it would raise questions.  So I trained Citadel soldiers by day, and Rebel fighters by night.</LB></LB>  Training your students to kill each other is a curse I’d never wish upon anyone…</CR>   … The pressure broke me, Traveler.</LB> All I wanted was for the war to stop.</LB></LB>  But in the end, I failed.  I tried to do what I thought was right, but instead I betrayed them all...</CR>   Our entire Kingdom burned in the ensuing war.</LB> So many souls lost, and I was to blame.</LB></LB>  All hope was lost, but then you arrived…</CR>   Every time a new <color=blue>Thread</color> is sewn and the story starts over, you triumph.  The King falls, the Stygian waters rise, and the people of this realm escape to the surface.</LB></LB>  And it ends with a promising future for the survivors… for Z…</CR>  You may be a source of hope for the others, Traveler, but my sins are set in stone.</LB></LB>  I shall play my role for all eternity if it guarantees them a brighter tomorrow.</LB> Let us not keep Fate waiting any longer!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_MUSINGS_OF_CHARON_1	Hello again, Traveler.</LB> The Thread has reset, and the loop continues. </LB></LB>  In your absence, I’ve taken the time to speak to <color=blue>Charon</color>.</LB> … He’s not much of a conversationalist, but he is a good listener.</CR>  Did you know the Chthonic Gods are considered benevolent beings?  They appear during grim times in human history to help us through.</LB></LB>  All of the Gods you have met on your journey have aided you in some way.  All except <color=blue>Charon</color>…</CR>  <color=blue>Geras</color> cleanses the traumas of our past, while <color=blue>Elpis</color> paves the path for our future.  Even the <color=blue>Keres</color> siblings renew the souls they consume.</LB></LB>  Yet <color=blue>Charon</color> takes, and gives nothing in return.  He may simply be the black sheep in the family, but I believe there is more to it than that.</CR>  For many, greed is the greatest sin.  Humans will steal, cheat, lie, and kill for wealth.  Kings and pharaohs bury themselves with their riches as people starve in the streets. </LB></LB>  <color=blue>Charon</color> takes that all away.  He strips you of your greatest weakness before you embark on your divine journey.</CR>  Or perhaps these are the musings of an idealistic soldier, who is ready to meet his end.</LB></LB>  Facing mortality makes philosophers of us all, Friend.</LB> Come, my blades have been waiting.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_SON_OF_LAMECH_1	Traveler, it’s strange.</LB></LB>  Recently I’ve found myself reminiscing more upon my childhood.</CR>  <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color> was my father.</LB></LB>  That may be surprising, but he was the father to many.  It was a mandate by the King that all Estuaries keep the lineage growing, although some followed it more than others.</CR>  To <color=blue>Lamech</color> I was nothing, but being a child of an Estuary changes your life, Traveler.</LB></LB>  The common folk called us ‘Citadel-born’.  Bound by blood to the Estuaries, we were never trusted, and suffered much disdain…</CR>   Growing up, we had nowhere to go, so most ended up as soldiers working for the Estuaries.  And every time another one of us joined the ranks, the bias would grow and the pattern continued.</LB></LB>  A truly vicious self-fulfilling prophecy.</CR>  I almost succumbed to that never-ending cycle myself, until I met <color=blue>Z</color>.  She believed in me and gave me a purpose.</LB></LB>  But I am not like Z.  She fought for a better future.</LB> … I only fought for her.</CR>  My path has been set, Traveler, but yours changes with every <color=blue>Thread</color>.</LB></LB>  Now let us continue this dance, and may your resolve never waver!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_OFF_ON_TRAVEL_1	 Traveler, thank you for all the talks we’ve had.</LB></LB>  These conversations have helped me gain a clearer perspective on my life.</CR>  Even though you completed your journey long ago, you continue to traverse new <color=blue>Threads</color> to uncover the tragic past of our sordid Kingdom.</LB></LB>  Your steadfast endeavour to bring to light our history is truly meritable, and has inspired me to do the same.</CR>    I’ve been taking the time to traverse the Citadel and resolve some unanswered questions, no matter how painful they may be.</LB></LB>  One day I hope to fully understand everything that transpired, and honor the sacrifices of the people.</CR>   But another <color=blue>Thread</color> has reached its end, and we shall battle once more.</LB></LB> Show me that you will always be the hero I believe you are!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_DISCOVERS_PLAN_1	Everyone has a plan, Traveler.</LB></LB>  Nobody is honest down here, not even me.</CR>  The Rebels wanted to do a surprise assault when the Estuaries gathered for the <color=blue>Ceremony of Return</color>.  Cut off all the heads of the hydra at once, as it were.</LB></LB>  It was a bold plan, but one I knew was never going to work.  As the ‘Master of Swords’, and <color=blue>Lamech’s</color> protégé, only I understood the Estuaries’ true strength.  The Rebels would have been massacred.</CR>  So I revealed their plan to <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color>.  He was supposed to snuff it out before it began.  Sacrifice a few people to save tens of thousands.</LB></LB>  Instead, he wanted the glory.  He wanted the war, so he let it happen…</CR>  By trying to do what I thought was right, I became what I hated the most, a traitorous ‘Citadel-born’.  And in the end I still failed to save anyone.  Myself, the Rebels, and <color=blue>Z</color>.</LB></LB>  … I gave up everything for nothing.</CR>   But in my recent quest to reveal the truth, I discovered life is full of schemers.</LB></LB>  It turns out I was never more than a puppet, being manipulated by more strings than I could count.</CR>   The Rebels never fully trusted me – they had contingencies planned in the event of my betrayal.  My actions never had an effect on the final outcome.</LB></LB>  But in the end, none of that mattered.  Even when the Rebels used my betrayal to ambush <color=blue>Lamech</color> when he was alone, he still single-handedly cut them all down. </CR>  Knowing I simply played my part gives me no solace.  I cannot forgive myself for my actions.  But instead of condemning myself, perhaps I can work towards making amends.</LB></LB>  Thank you, Traveler, for helping me come to terms with everything that has happened.  It has been many, many Threads.</CR>  … Now, unsheathe your weapon, Traveler.</LB></LB>  Let us not break tradition when we are so close to the end!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_GIVES_YOU_KEY_1	We meet again, friend.</LB></LB>
 
 It’s taken me a long time to come to grips with my actions, and I couldn’t have done it without you.</CR>
 
 I have a gift I would like to give you, but before I do that, we must let the traditions continue.</LB></LB>
 
 One last battle for old time’s sake.</LB>
 But this time, let us not hold back!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEATING_FIGHT_1	Take as many <color=blue>Threads</color> as you need, Friend.</LB>
 I am grateful for the company.</CR>
 
 
 No matter how many journeys you take, I’ll always be waiting, ready to test you.</LB>
 Now raise your blade.  Honor demands we give our all!	
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_BY_PLAYER_1	I was right about you, Traveler.</LB>
 You are not like the King.</LB></LB>
 
 Thank you for sparing me. I’ve seen your thoughts, I now know your intentions.</CR>
 
 The Fruit is yours to do as you will.</LB></LB>
 
 Speak to Charon to the West.</LB>
 Your journey home has been paid for in advance.
 	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_BY_PLAYER_2	… Good luck facing your brother, Traveler.</LB>
 It is always difficult to turn one’s blade against family.</CR>
 
 I failed to find the resolve, and the people paid the price. 	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_BY_PLAYER_3	… Thank you for the fight, Traveler.</LB>
 Your intentions are clear. </CR>
 
 My journey is over, but yours has just begun.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_BY_PLAYER_4	… The <color=blue>Thread</color> continues. </CR>
 
 Thank you for always fighting for the people.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_BY_PLAYER_5	… The Fruit is yours, Friend.</CR>
 
 May luck be with you in the battle ahead.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_SPECIAL_BEATEN_GIVE_KEY_1	Thank you for the battles, Friend.</LB> And I apologize for being so secretive of late.</CR>  For more lifetimes than I can count, I’ve punished myself for what happened down here.</LB></LB>  It was easier to do that than pick up all the pieces.  But that’s changing…</CR>  One last gift for you, Friend.  It helped me find closure, and perhaps it will help you as well.	
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_IDLE_TALK_1	My journey ends here, Traveler.</LB></LB>  I made my choices long ago.</LB> It is time for me to accept the consequences.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_IDLE_TALK_2	Charon’s boat lies just to the West, Traveler.</LB></LB>
 
 Take it and return home.</LB>
 The King awaits you.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_IDLE_TALK_3	I arranged for your passage in advance, Traveler.</LB></LB>   Typically, <color=blue>Charon</color> would never let someone cross the Stygian without paying their dues… But even gods have their vices.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_IDLE_TALK_4	… <color=blue>Charon</color> always had an appetite for lost <color=blue>Sacred Obols</color> that would wash ashore at times.</LB></LB>  … The Estuaries would pay a generous sum to anyone who brought them one of these relics.</CR>  They hoarded them in anticipation of the <color=blue>Great Return</color>.</LB> A token for every man, woman, and child to cross the Stygian Ocean when their King came down to release them from this purgatory. </LB></LB>  No one would be left behind.</CR>   … Sometimes I forget the virtues the Estuaries held before it all collapsed. </LB> Thank you for helping me remember the good in them.	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_BEATEN_IDLE_TALK_5	Traveler, thank you for putting the Estuaries to rest.</LB></LB>
 
 It could not have been done without you.	
\\		
\\		
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEAT_FIGHT_1	You have what we don’t, Traveler, a second chance.</LB></LB>
 
 Don’t let complacency weaken your resolve!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEAT_FIGHT_2	I will show you no mercy, Traveler.</LB></LB>  Honor demands you show me none either!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEAT_FIGHT_3	This battle is inevitable, Traveler.</LB></LB>
 
 Duty drives us both!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEAT_FIGHT_4	The fear of death has lost its edge on you. </LB></LB>
 
 Let only victory drive you forward!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEAT_FIGHT_5	This is a life and death battle for me, but only a training lesson for you.</LB></LB>
 
 Give it your all, or we’ll be locked in battle for all eternity!	
LOC_ID_J_GARDEN_REPEAT_FIGHT_6	Your word is not enough, Traveler.  I demand the truth.</LB></LB>
 
 Save yourself a painful loop and defeat me!

May your wisdom and character guide all who come after.'</LB></LB>  After giving his benediction, the priest removes the parchment, returning it to the safety of the Reliquary, while Cain bandages his new steward's wounded hand.

 Plus, being down there has helped me see what’s important in life. I’m gonna spend the next few years reconnecting with my kid.</LB></LB>
 
 He may be old now, and he may be senile, and he may tell the worst stories I ever heard, but you don’t often get the chance to make up for your past mistakes…</CR>
 
 … (sniff) Sorry, I think I’m leakin’ some oil.</LB></LB>
 
 Gnyarf!  That was a ‘safe’ joke.</LB>
 ... No it wasn't.  I'm actually crying.	
LOC_ID_LIVING_SAFE_OUTRO_FRIENDS_REPEAT_1	Best of luck, Friend-o.</LB></LB>
 
 And if you ever need a loan, you know who to ask.	
LOC_ID_GERAS_OUTRO_STRANGER_INTRO_1	Traveler, I knew you could do it.</LB></LB>
 
 I knew it because I dreamt it.</CR>
 
 My dreams don’t always come true, so my previous statement means nothing.</LB></LB>
 
 Did I mention that I have narcolepsy?	
LOC_ID_GERAS_OUTRO_STRANGER_REPEAT_1	Farewell Traveler, perhaps we will meet in <color=blue>Erebus</color> again.	
LOC_ID_GERAS_OUTRO_FRIENDS_INTRO_1	You saved more than just the people here, Traveler.  You’ve saved the lives of generations to come. </CR>
 
 Your actions and the scars you’ve healed in <color=blue>Erebus</color> will not be recognized by others, but I know glory was never your goal, Traveler.</LB></LB>
 
 The lands would have rejected you otherwise.</CR>
 
 This is only the beginning of your journey, Traveler.</LB>
 There are more great things to come.	
LOC_ID_GERAS_OUTRO_FRIENDS_REPEAT_1	The invitation is always open if you ever wish to join us in the <color=blue>Drift House</color>, Traveler.  It always helps to have a mortal’s point of view on our journey.</LB></LB>
 
 Plus, I’ve always wanted an underling.	
LOC_ID_ELPIS_OUTRO_STRANGER_INTRO_1	The Tapestry continues its weave, Traveler.</LB></LB>
 
 Your actions here are just the beginning.	
LOC_ID_ELPIS_OUTRO_STRANGER_REPEAT_1	The one constant in humans is that they all need time and experience to become better people.  Most are offered neither. </LB></LB>
 
 Let us meet again in the future, Traveler.  There is much more to see.	
LOC_ID_ELPIS_OUTRO_FRIENDS_INTRO_1	The imbalance <color=blue>Cain</color> brought to this world threatened to tear the <color=blue>Great Tapestry</color> apart. We may seem oppositional at times, Traveler, but we <color=blue>Cthonic</color> beings must serve the balance too.</CR>
 
 Perhaps it was not our place to intervene as much as we did, but we feared the outcome of inaction.</LB></LB>
 
 We may never know the full consequences of what we’ve done, but we can live knowing we stayed true to ourselves.</CR>
 
 
 I hope the world is a better place for you and your kind, Traveler.	
LOC_ID_ELPIS_OUTRO_FRIENDS_REPEAT_1	The future is stabilized but the past can always be perfected.</LB>
 If you wish to continue your journey, feel free to speak to me in the future.

LOC_ID_CHARON_OUTRO_FRIENDS_REPEAT_1	… Seek new lands, Traveler.</LB>
 Hamson belongs to the Stygian. 	
LOC_ID_PIZZA_GIRL_OUTRO_STRANGER_INTRO_1	You did it Traveler!  You saved us all!</LB></LB>
 
 Sorry I couldn’t help you, I had to go back and get as many people into Castle Hamson as possible.</CR>
 
 While you were fighting the Estuaries, I was bringing refugees from the Kingdom back across the Stygian ocean with me.</CR>
 
 Thankfully the folks in Castle Hamson were more than willing to take in the villagers when the waters started rising.</CR>
 
 In the end, it was just people helpin’ people, y’know?  Glad that’s what it all boiled down to.	
LOC_ID_PIZZA_GIRL_OUTRO_STRANGER_REPEAT_1	…. Sorry… Just lost in thought.</LB></LB>
 
 A lot of people were saved today… A lot of people.</CR>

 A lot of people were saved today, just not everyone.	
LOC_ID_PIZZA_GIRL_OUTRO_J_REVEAL_INTRO_1	I know we just got out, but there’s so much to do.</LB>
 A lot of people are homeless now, and I don’t think anyone wants to hang around <color=blue>Castle Hamson</color> because it doesn’t feel right.</CR>
 
 Our journey’s just begun, Friend.</LB></LB>
 
 I’m not sure where we’ll go, but a lot of people are counting on us.	
LOC_ID_PIZZA_GIRL_OUTRO_J_REVEAL_REPEAT_1	Thank you again, Friend!</LB></LB>
 
 We really couldn’t have done this without you!</LB>
 If you’ve nowhere else to go, I hope you’ll come and join us!	
LOC_ID_J_OUTRO_FRIENDS_INTRO_1	There are still many sins I need to atone for, but before I could help others I had to help myself.</LB>
 Thank you for making me see that.</LB></LB>
 
 I was in a dark place, and I needed a hand to climb out.</CR>
 
 I’ve lived a hundred years, but I feel like my life’s just started.</LB>
 And I don’t think I’m the only one that feels that way.</LB></LB>
 
 Everyone here deserves a new life, and I owe it to all of them to help rebuild it.

LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_DOOR_LOCKED_TITLE_1	Mysterious Door	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_DOOR_LOCKED_1	The door is locked.	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_DOOR_UNLOCKED_1	The Mysterious Key was used to unlock the door.	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_HOW_THEY_MOVED_PEOPLE_1	(A giant diorama sits on the table.  Small figurines show the location of supply rooms and Rebel soldiers stashed throughout Citadel Agartha and Axis Mundi.</LB></LB>
 
 The date labeled beside the figurines show some of these soldiers have been in hiding for months.) 	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_HOW_THEY_MOVED_PEOPLE_2	(A massive schedule shows when and where Rebel soldiers are to meet up with <color=blue>Z</color> inside Citadel Agartha.</LB></LB>
 
 It seems like they were using <color=blue>Z’s</color> power over the <color=blue>Shift</color> to place Rebel soldiers all throughout the Citadel.) 	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_TRACKING_CITADEL_BORN_1	(A list displays the names of hundreds of Citadel-born soldiers who’ve switched sides and joined the Rebels.  Each convert is assigned a tracker - a true-blooded Rebel whose job it was to keep tabs on them.</LB></LB>  Written at the top of the sheet is the name <color=blue>Jonah (J)</color>.  Next to that is the name of his tracker, <color=blue>Gregory</color>.) 	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_GREGORYS_NOTES_1	(A collection of notes <color=blue>Gregory</color> has been keeping on <color=blue>J</color>:</LB></LB>
 
 One document praises <color=blue>J's</color> excellent methods in training Rebel soldiers, but notes he is showing severe signs of stress.</LB></LB>
 Another document lists several infractions <color=blue>J</color> has committed in opposition to the false ‘Gate of Return Plan’.)</CR>
 
 (A final note basically states that since <color=blue>J</color> is currently in a relationship with <color=blue>Z</color>, any antagonistic action towards him should be discouraged.)	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_BETRAYAL_NOTES_1	(There's a document tracking the behavior of all individuals considered at high risk of double-crossing the Rebellion.</LB></LB>
 
 <color=blue>J’s</color> name appears on it, with a note beside it mentioning a contingency plan: ‘Rebel Road’.) 	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_Z_SAVING_PEOPLE_1	(This document is newer than the rest.</LB></LB>  It seems to track the number of survivors successfully ferried from the Kerguelen Plateau to Castle Hamson.</CR>  There are hundreds of names. <color=blue>Z</color> had been using her power over the <color=blue>Shift</color> to create shortcuts for Rebels throughout the Citadel.  Almost everyone was saved.)</CR>   (Scribbled at the bottom of the page, a small note reads: “Lethargic, appetite's changed, and she gets bouts of morning sickness.  Could <color=blue>Z</color> be…”</LB></LB>  … The last portion of the note seems to have been torn off.)	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_REBEL_ROAD_CONTINGENCY_1	(This outlines all protocols and actions to implement in the case that <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color> discovers the Rebel army and attempts to stop them.</CR>
 
 A diagram shows the placement of thousands of tonnes of explosives all across Axis Mundi, ready to be ignited after <color=blue>Lamech</color> crosses, in an attempt to strand him on the other side.</LB></LB>
 
 The Rebel Road network is a network of wooden walkways running across the treetops throughout the Kerguelen Forest.  It allows Rebels to cross through the lands unnoticed, and can be served as an elevated position from which archers can ambush <color=blue>Estuary Lamech</color>.</CR>
 
 The <color=blue>Narrow Praxis</color> specialized training program has been given the go-ahead, in order to train archers for this contingency.) 	
LOC_ID_REBEL_HIDEOUT_FALSE_PLANS_1	(The ‘Ceremony of Return’ plan lays strewn out on the table.  Fake documents and false names fill every corner.  Months of work were placed into creating this intricate facade; a necessary precaution against betrayal.)

\\	NOTES TO SELF	
\\	The Muck = Land that's slowly being overtaken by a black substance that grows out of the river styx.	
\\	Blooms = Pitch black tendrils that sometimes burst from the ground throughout the kingdom.  It spreads the Muck around.   Everyone believes it comes from the Stygian Waters.   You later find out soldiers are ordered to stop killing blooms and instead contain them.   Even later you can discover that the people in the Academy have made the discovery the the  blooms aren't coming from the Stygian well,  it's the roots of the Tree of Life that everyone's protecting. The constant hacking of the roots has delayed the Tree's growth.	
\\	Drowned = Soldiers and townsfolk who've died, but their bodies have been re-animated by the Muck.   These are the enemies that you fight.  Drowned is a universal term for all of the enemies in the game world	
\\		
\\		
\\	Byarith's Memory	
\\	Twice we've found ourselves drowning in the blight of the Stygian Waters, and twice we were saved by the grace of our liege. We won't survive the third.</LB></LB>  Those who take the dive with me... Know that this is not what <color=blue>Estuary Mehujael</color> would have wanted.</LB> This mission is no longer for honour, this is for vengeance.
