# Welcome to Triangulator ∞!
This mod does one thing: it removes the lifespan limit from the Triangulator bolts.
This mod was suggested by TheCopyUniverse, after a bug doing the same thing was found by Tired Potati in my Reduced Visuals mod.
Both users mentioned are available on the CDG Discord server.

## This mod contains:
- Infinite bouncing of Triangulator bolts

## How to install:
1. Download the file
2. Backup your sciptable_objects file located in **“GamePath”\Rogue Legacy 2_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles.**
3. Replace the original file with the modded one.
4. Have fun!
